# Appendix A: Disease-by-Disease Reference Table

**How to read this table**: Each row is a disease or disease class. Columns capture the current state of mechanistic understanding, treatment options, early detection feasibility, and the dominant bottleneck preventing cure. This is the "one-page lookup" for anyone deciding where to invest their career or their capital.

**Legend**: Mechanism status — Known (>70% of pathophysiology understood), Partial (key pathways identified but gaps remain), Minimal (largely idiopathic or polygenic without clear causal chain). Treatment status — Curative (disease can be eliminated), Disease-modifying (progression slowed/halted), Symptomatic (symptoms managed, disease progresses), None (no approved treatment). Detection — refers to feasibility of catching the disease before irreversible damage.

## A.9 Summary Statistics

| Category | # of diseases listed | % with curative therapy | % with no approved therapy | % detectable early |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Cardiovascular/Metabolic | 9 | 0% | 0% | 67% |
| Cancers | 10 | ~20% (early-stage only) | 0% | 50% |
| Neurological/Psychiatric | 8 | 0% | 25% | 12% |
| Respiratory | 4 | 25% (CF with Trikafta) | 0% | 25% |
| Autoimmune | 4 | 0% | 0% | 25% |
| Infectious | 5 | 60% | 0% | 80% |
| Rare/Genetic | 6 | 33% (SCD, SMA, CF) | 17% | 83% |
| Aging/Degeneration | 4 | 0% | 50% | 50% |
| **Total** | **50** | **~14%** | **~10%** | **~45%** |

**The central insight**: Even across 50 of the most important diseases, only ~14% have anything approaching a cure. Nearly half cannot be reliably detected before significant damage occurs. The dominant bottleneck varies by disease class: neurological diseases suffer from irreversibility and BBB; cancers from late detection and resistance; psychiatric conditions from unknown mechanisms; rare diseases from economics and scale.
