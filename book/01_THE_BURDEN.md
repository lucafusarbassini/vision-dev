## 1.1 TOP CAUSES OF DEATH GLOBALLY

**Total global deaths in 2023: ~58-59 million** (GBD 2023). Of these, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for ~74% (~43 million), with cardiovascular diseases alone causing roughly 1 in 3 deaths.

### 1.1.1 The Top 10 Killers (GBD 2023)

| Rank | Cause | Deaths (2023) | Trend vs. 2000 |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Ischaemic heart disease** | ~9.4M | +2.7M since 2000 |
| 2 | **Stroke** | ~7.1M | Increasing |
| 3 | **COPD** | ~3.5M | Stable |
| 4 | **Lower respiratory infections** | ~2.5M | Declining |
| 5 | **Neonatal disorders** | ~2.3M | Declining (-30% since 1990) |
| 6 | **Trachea/bronchus/lung cancers** | ~2.0M+ | +58% since 2000 |
| 7 | **Diabetes mellitus** | ~3.4M (IDF 2024) | Rising fast |
| 8 | **Road injuries** | ~1.4M | Stable |
| 9 | **Chronic kidney disease** | ~1.48M | Rising (doubled since 1990) |
| 10 | **Diarrheal diseases** | ~1.2M | Declining |

**COVID-19**: Ranked #1 in 2021, dropped to #20 by 2023 as pandemic acute mortality subsided.

### 1.1.2 By Disease Category -- Total Deaths

| Category | Annual deaths (2023 est.) | % of global deaths |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Cardiovascular diseases** | **19.2 million** | ~33% |
| **All cancers** | **10.4 million** | ~18% |
| **Chronic respiratory (COPD, asthma)** | ~4.0 million | ~7% |
| **Diabetes** | ~3.4 million | ~6% |
| **Infectious diseases (excl. COVID)** | ~8-9 million | ~15% |
| **Neurological (dementia, Parkinson's, etc.)** | ~3.5 million | ~6% |
| **Kidney disease** | ~1.5 million | ~2.5% |
| **Neonatal conditions** | ~2.3 million | ~4% |
| **Injuries (all)** | ~4.4 million | ~7.5% |
| **Digestive diseases** | ~2.5 million | ~4% |

### 1.1.3 Cardiovascular Disease in Detail

- **19.2 million CVD deaths** in 2023 (up from 13.1M in 1990) -- a 47% increase in absolute deaths over 33 years.
- Ischaemic heart disease affected ~240 million people in 2023.
- **437 million CVD DALYs** globally in 2023 (1.4-fold increase from 320M in 1990).
- Among people aged 70+, CVD accounts for >40% of all deaths.
- Remaining lifetime risk of major CVD at age 40: **34.8%**; at age 90: **16.7%**.
- Key molecular drivers: atherosclerotic plaque formation (LDL oxidation, foam cell accumulation, endothelial dysfunction), hypertension-driven remodeling, myocardial fibrosis.
- **Treatment response**: Statins reduce major CV events by ~25-35%. Anti-hypertensives reduce stroke by ~35-40%. But adherence is low globally -- an estimated 50% of patients discontinue medications within 1 year. Post-MI, 5-year mortality remains ~20%.

### 1.1.4 Cancer in Detail

- **20 million new cancer cases** and **9.7 million cancer deaths** in 2022 (GLOBOCAN/IARC). Projected to rise to 35 million new cases by 2050.
- ~1 in 5 people develop cancer in their lifetime. 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women die from it.
- 53.5 million people alive within 5 years of a cancer diagnosis (5-year prevalence).
- **All cancers combined 5-year survival: ~70%** (high-income countries; much lower in LMICs).

**Top cancers by incidence (2022)**:
1. Lung: 2.5M new cases (12.4%), 1.8M deaths (18.7%)
2. Breast (female): 2.3M cases (11.6%), 670K deaths
3. Colorectal: 1.9M cases (9.6%), 900K deaths
4. Prostate: 1.5M cases (7.3%)
5. Stomach: 970K cases, 660K deaths

**5-year survival by type (all stages combined)**:

| Cancer | 5-yr survival | When detected early |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Breast | ~90% | 99% (Stage I) |
| Prostate | ~97% | ~100% (localized) |
| Colorectal | ~65% | 91% (Stage I-II) vs. 13% (Stage IV) |
| Lung | ~28% | ~60% (localized) vs. 7% (distant) |
| Liver | ~22% | ~35% (localized) vs. 3% (distant) |
| Pancreatic | ~13% | 44% (localized) vs. 3% (Stage IV) |
| Glioblastoma | ~8% | Minimal improvement even with early detection |
| Ovarian | ~50% | 89% (Stage I) vs. <20% (Stage IV) |

### 1.1.5 Infectious Disease

Despite dramatic declines, infectious diseases still kill ~8-9 million annually:
- **Tuberculosis**: 1.25 million deaths in 2023 (43% rate decline vs. 2010, but absolute numbers stubbornly high)
- **HIV/AIDS**: ~630K deaths (2023); 39M living with HIV; 43% rate decline since 2010
- **Malaria**: 597,000 deaths from 263 million cases (2023); 76% of deaths in children <5
- **Lower respiratory infections**: ~2.5M deaths -- the deadliest communicable disease category post-COVID
- **Diarrheal diseases**: ~1.2M deaths -- mostly children in LMICs
- **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**: 4.71 million deaths *associated with* bacterial AMR in 2021, including 1.14 million *directly attributable*. Projected to cause 1.91M direct deaths/year by 2050 (70% increase). Over 39 million cumulative AMR deaths forecast between 2025-2050.

### 1.1.6 Diabetes

- **Global prevalence**: 828 million adults living with diabetes (2024, IDF Atlas 11th Ed.), quadrupled since 1990. 11.1% of adults worldwide.
- **Deaths**: 3.4 million in 2024 -- 1 death every 9 seconds.
- **Treatment gap**: 59% of adults with diabetes remain untreated (~450 million people). In Africa, <40% receive glucose-lowering medication.
- **Healthcare cost**: >$1 trillion USD annually (338% increase over 17 years).
- **Projection**: ~900 million affected by 2050.
- **Molecular basis**: Type 2 -- insulin resistance driven by lipotoxicity, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic inflammation in adipose tissue. Type 1 -- autoimmune beta-cell destruction (HLA-mediated T-cell attack). MODY -- monogenic forms (HNF1A, GCK, HNF4A mutations) account for ~1-5% of diabetes.

### 1.1.7 Chronic Respiratory Disease

- **COPD**: >400 million affected globally. 3.5 million deaths/year. Third leading cause of death. Projected to approach 600 million cases by 2050.
- Leading attributable risk factors: smoking (34.8%), ambient particulate matter (22.2%), household air pollution (19.5%), occupational exposure (15.8%).
- **Treatment**: Noncurative. Bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids slow progression but do not reverse disease. No approved disease-modifying therapy. Lung transplant is the only "cure."

### 1.1.8 Chronic Kidney Disease

- **788 million people** aged 20+ had CKD in 2023 (doubled from 378M in 1990). Global prevalence: 14.2%.
- **1.48 million deaths** in 2023 -- now the 9th leading cause of death.
- Impaired kidney function accounts for 11.5% of cardiovascular deaths.
- **Treatment**: ACE inhibitors/ARBs slow progression. SGLT2 inhibitors (a recent breakthrough) reduce CKD progression by ~30-40%. But no cure exists for advanced CKD beyond dialysis and transplant.

## 1.2 TOP CAUSES OF DALYs (DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS)

**Total global DALYs in 2023: ~2.8 billion** -- roughly steady since 2010 despite population growth, meaning age-standardized rates have declined.

DALYs capture both premature death (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). This is the most comprehensive measure of disease impact.

### Top Causes of DALYs (GBD 2023 Estimates)

| Rank | Cause | DALYs (millions) | Trend |
|------|-------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | Ischaemic heart disease | ~185M | Rising (+1.4x since 1990) |
| 2 | Neonatal disorders | ~170M | Declining |
| 3 | Stroke | ~157M | Rising |
| 4 | Lower respiratory infections | ~110M | Declining |
| 5 | Diabetes | ~80M+ | Rising fast (+14% age-standardized since 2010) |
| 6 | COPD | ~75M | Stable |
| 7 | Road injuries | ~70M | Stable |
| 8 | Diarrheal diseases | ~60M | Declining |
| 9 | Low back pain | ~65M | Rising |
| 10 | Depressive disorders | ~56M YLDs | Rising (+16.4% since 2010) |

**Total CVD DALYs**: 437 million in 2023.

### Fastest-Rising DALY Burdens (2010-2021, Age-Standardized)

1. **Anxiety disorders**: +16.7%
2. **Depressive disorders**: +16.4%
3. **Diabetes**: +14.0%

These represent the diseases that are *accelerating* in burden, not just growing with population. Mental health and metabolic disease dominate the acceleration.

### The YLD Landscape (Non-Fatal Burden)

The leading causes of YLDs are strikingly different from mortality rankings:
1. **Low back pain** -- the single largest cause of disability worldwide
2. **Depressive disorders** -- 56.3M YLDs (2021)
3. **Headache disorders** (migraine + tension-type)
4. **Anxiety disorders** -- 42.5M YLDs
5. **Age-related hearing loss**
6. **Diabetes** (complications: neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy)
7. **Neck pain**
8. **Oral disorders** (dental caries, periodontal disease)
9. **COPD**
10. **Iron-deficiency anemia**

This list reveals an important insight: **the diseases that disable are not the diseases that kill.** Most disability burden comes from musculoskeletal, mental health, and sensory conditions -- areas chronically underfunded relative to their impact.

## 1.3 DISEASES WITH THE LARGEST UNMET THERAPEUTIC NEED

### 1.3.1 Diseases Where No Effective Disease-Modifying Therapy Exists

| Disease | Prevalence | Median survival | Current best treatment |
|---------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Glioblastoma** | ~300K/yr globally | 14-16 months | Temozolomide + radiation (extends survival ~2 months) |
| **Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma** | ~500K/yr | 6-12 months (metastatic) | FOLFIRINOX (extends survival ~4 months) |
| **ALS** | ~30K prevalent in US | 2-5 years | Riluzole extends survival ~3 months. Tofersen for SOD1 subset only (~2% of cases) |
| **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** | ~3M globally | 2.5-3.5 years | Pirfenidone/nintedanib slow decline (+2.5 yrs), do not reverse |
| **Huntington disease** | ~30K in US | 15-20 yrs post-onset | No disease-modifying therapy. ASO trials (tominersen) failed |
| **Alzheimer disease** | ~55M globally (dementia) | 8-12 years post-diagnosis | Lecanemab/donanemab slow decline ~27-35% but do not halt it |
| **Multiple system atrophy** | ~5/100K | 6-10 years | Symptomatic only; no approved disease-modifying therapy |
| **Progressive supranuclear palsy** | ~5-7/100K | 5-8 years | No approved treatment |
| **Treatment-resistant depression** | ~100M+ (30% of MDD) | Chronic | ~33% fail adequate trials. Ketamine/psilocybin emerging but limited access |

### 1.3.2 Diseases Where Treatments Exist but Response Rates Are Poor

| Disease | Treatment response rate | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| **Major depressive disorder** | 37% remit after 1st-line antidepressant (STAR*D); cumulative 67% after 4 lines | 30-33% are treatment-resistant |
| **Schizophrenia** | ~20-30% are treatment-resistant (clozapine-eligible) | 23.2M prevalent globally; 14.8M DALYs |
| **PTSD** | 50% non-response to CBT; 20-40% non-response to SSRIs | 6% lifetime prevalence in US; 13% in military |
| **Metastatic solid tumors** (most types) | Median PFS on checkpoint inhibitors: 2-7 months for most | Durable responses in ~15-20% of unselected patients |
| **Heart failure (HFpEF)** | No therapy shown to reduce mortality until SGLT2i | ~50% of HF is HFpEF; 5-yr mortality 50% |
| **COPD** | No disease-modifying therapy | >400M affected |
| **Chronic low back pain** | ~30-50% report meaningful relief | Leading cause of disability |
| **Fibromyalgia** | ~30-40% respond to duloxetine/pregabalin | Mechanism poorly understood |
| **Irritable bowel syndrome** | ~30-40% respond to any given therapy | ~10% global prevalence |
| **Lupus (SLE)** | ~50% achieve low disease activity; flare rate remains ~50-60%/yr | Belimumab first new approval in 50 years |

## 1.4 THE "SILENT KILLERS" -- Diseases That Start Years to Decades Before Symptoms

This section documents the profound temporal gap between molecular disease onset and clinical diagnosis. This gap represents both the scale of the early-detection opportunity and the tragedy of current practice.

### 1.4.1 Documented Preclinical Timelines

| Disease | Molecular onset before symptoms | Key preclinical markers | Current avg. detection |
|---------|-------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Alzheimer disease** | **15-20 years** | Amyloid-beta plaques (15-20 yrs), tau tangles (6-10 yrs), synaptic loss | At symptom onset (MCI or dementia) |
| **Parkinson disease** | **10-20 years** | Alpha-synuclein in olfactory bulb/vagus nerve, dopamine neuron loss, REM sleep behavior disorder (5-20 yrs pre-diagnosis) | At motor symptom onset (60-80% dopamine neurons already lost) |
| **Type 1 diabetes** | **10+ years** | Autoantibodies (GAD65 in 82% >10 yrs before onset); 2+ autoantibodies = 84% risk by age 18 | At DKA/hyperglycemia |
| **Type 2 diabetes** | **5-10 years** | Insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, HbA1c rise | Often after complications develop |
| **Rheumatoid arthritis** | **3-7 years** | ACPA/RF autoantibodies appear years before joint symptoms | At joint inflammation/destruction |
| **Systemic lupus** | **5-10 years** | Anti-Ro, anti-dsDNA, ANA antibodies; complement activation | At multi-organ involvement |
| **Multiple sclerosis** | **5+ years** | Autoantibody reactivity; elevated neurofilament light (sNfL) indicating axonal damage | At clinical relapse |
| **Colorectal cancer** | **10-15 years** | Adenomatous polyps progress through adenoma-carcinoma sequence (APC -> KRAS -> TP53 mutations) | Often at symptomatic/advanced stage without screening |
| **Pancreatic cancer** | **10-20 years** | Initiating KRAS mutations present decades before diagnosis; PanIN progression | 80%+ diagnosed with unresectable/metastatic disease |
| **Breast cancer** | **6-15 years** | DCIS/early clonal expansion; BRCA1/2 carriers accumulate driver events over decades | Mammography detects ~1-2cm tumors (billions of cells) |
| **Ovarian cancer** | **~7-10 years** | Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) lesions in fallopian tubes | 75% diagnosed at Stage III/IV |
| **Cervical cancer** | **10-20 years** | HPV infection -> CIN1/2/3 -> invasive (decade+ timeline) | Pap smear catches pre-cancer effectively |
| **Atherosclerosis/CVD** | **20-30+ years** | Fatty streaks in aortas of teenagers; endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation begins in 20s | Often at first MI/stroke |
| **Chronic kidney disease** | **10-15 years** | GFR decline, albuminuria, tubulointerstitial fibrosis | Often at Stage 3-4 (>50% function lost) |
| **Hepatocellular carcinoma** | **20-30 years** | Chronic HBV/HCV -> fibrosis -> cirrhosis -> HCC | Often at advanced/unresectable stage |

### 1.4.2 The Clonal Expansion Timeline in Cancer

Recent genomic studies have shown that cancer-initiating somatic mutations can be present for **decades** before clinical cancer:

- In breast cancer with der(1;16) rearrangements, the derivative chromosome was acquired during **early puberty to late adolescence**, followed by emergence of a common tumor ancestor by the patient's **early 30s** -- full decades before clinical diagnosis.
- Driver mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms are acquired **early in life** and the development of clinical cancer takes decades.
- **Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)**: Cancer-associated mutations (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1) are found in >10% of people over 70, years to decades before potential hematologic malignancy.
- Normal tissues (esophagus, skin, colon, lung) harbor **extensive clonal expansions** with cancer-associated mutations even in cancer-free individuals, suggesting that somatic mutation and positive selection are *universal* -- it is the additional events that determine cancer vs. non-cancer.

### 1.4.3 Implications

The central implication is staggering: **most of the major diseases of adulthood are already well-established at the molecular level years to decades before any symptoms appear.** Current medicine operates almost entirely at the symptomatic end of the disease timeline. Moving detection and intervention earlier into the preclinical window is one of the highest-leverage opportunities in all of biomedicine.

---

## 1.5 MONOGENIC & RARE DISEASES AS A COLLECTIVE BURDEN

### Key Numbers

- **Total identified rare diseases**: >7,000 (some estimates say ~10,000)
- **Total people affected globally**: ~300 million (roughly 4% of the global population)
- **In the US**: ~30 million Americans (~1 in 10)
- **Percentage with ANY approved therapy**: ~5% (~350-500 diseases have at least one approved treatment)
- **Percentage with known genetic/molecular cause**: ~40-50% of known genetic conditions have identified molecular causes
- **Pediatric impact**: ~50% of rare disease patients are children. Rare diseases are the leading cause of death in children <5 in many countries.
- **Diagnostic odyssey**: Average time to diagnosis: 4-7 years. ~30% of rare disease patients never receive a definitive diagnosis.

### The Genetic Landscape

- ~80% of rare diseases are genetic in origin.
- Single-gene (Mendelian) disorders: ~5,000-7,000 identified, affecting ~8% of the population over a lifetime.
- Chromosomal disorders (Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, etc.): ~1 in 150 live births.
- Mitochondrial disorders: ~1 in 5,000 live births.

### Diseases With Recent Transformative Therapies

| Disease | Prevalence | Therapy | Impact |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Spinal muscular atrophy** | ~1/10,000 births | Nusinersen (ASO), onasemnogene (gene therapy), risdiplam (small molecule) | Transformed from fatal in infancy to near-normal development if treated pre-symptomatically |
| **Cystic fibrosis** | ~1/3,400 births | Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta) | ~90% of CF patients eligible; near-normal lung function in many |
| **Sickle cell disease** | 7.74M globally (2021) | Gene therapy (Casgevy/exagamglogene), lentiviral (Lyfgenia) | Potentially curative but limited to ~6 centers in all of Africa vs. 215 in US |
| **Hemophilia A/B** | ~400K globally | Gene therapy (valoctocogene, etranacogene) | Single infusion; reduced/eliminated bleeding episodes |
| **Duchenne muscular dystrophy** | ~1/5,000 male births | One gene therapy approved (delandistrogene); ASO exon-skipping drugs | Modest benefit; no cure yet |

### The Orphan Drug Paradox

More than half of FDA drug approvals in 2024 targeted rare diseases. Over 1,000 orphan drugs have been approved in the US. Yet only ~5% of rare diseases have ANY approved treatment. The math: approved therapies cluster around the same few hundred diseases while >6,500 diseases have no treatment at all.

### Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Study in Global Health Inequity

- 7.74 million people affected globally (2021); 515,000 new births annually.
- Sub-Saharan Africa: ~80% of global cases.
- **Mortality**: 376,000 estimated total deaths in 2021 (vs. 34,400 officially recorded -- 11x undercount).
- 81,100 deaths in children <5 (12th leading cause of under-5 mortality).
- Gene therapy exists (Casgevy, approved 2023) but requires high-resource settings.
- In Africa: 6 transplant centers for the entire continent. In the US: 215 centers.
- **Cost of gene therapy**: ~$2.2 million per patient.
- **Cost of hydroxyurea** (existing treatment): ~$100/year -- but unavailable to most African patients.

## 1.6 MENTAL HEALTH BURDEN

### 1.6.1 Scale of the Problem

- **>1 billion people** worldwide experienced a mental disorder in 2023 (WHO, September 2025 report).
- Mental disorders account for **17% of all years lived with disability (YLDs)** globally.
- 15% of the world's population had a mental disorder in 2023.
- Between 2010 and 2021, absolute cases increased ~50% due to population growth and true incidence rise.

### 1.6.2 Specific Conditions

**Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**
- 332.4 million prevalent cases globally (2021); 56.3M YLDs -- 2nd highest cause of disability.
- Age-standardized DALYs: +16.4% (2010-2021).
- **Treatment response**: Only 37% achieve remission with first-line antidepressant (STAR*D). After 4 sequential treatment steps, cumulative remission: 67%. Meaning ~33% remain treatment-resistant.
- **Treatment gap**: In LMICs, >75% of people with depression receive no treatment. Even in high-income countries, ~50% go untreated.
- **Molecular basis**: Monoamine hypothesis (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine depletion) explains only ~30% of cases. Newer models: neuroinflammation (elevated IL-6, TNF-alpha), HPA axis dysregulation, glutamate/GABA imbalance, impaired neuroplasticity (reduced BDNF), gut-brain axis dysfunction.

**Anxiety Disorders**
- 359.2 million prevalent cases globally (2021); 42.5M YLDs.
- Age-standardized DALYs: +16.7% (2010-2021) -- the fastest-rising mental health burden.
- Depression + anxiety together account for 63.1% of all mental disorder cases globally.
- **Treatment gap**: 71% of global anxiety burden could be avoided with optimal treatment access. High-income countries spend 25x more on mental health treatment than LMICs.

**Schizophrenia**
- 23.18 million prevalent cases globally (2021); 14.82M DALYs.
- 1.22 million new cases annually.
- Prevalence increased >70% since 1990 (largely due to population growth; age-standardized rates stable).
- **Treatment response**: ~30% of patients are treatment-resistant. Clozapine is the only drug with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it requires regular blood monitoring and has severe side effects (agranulocytosis, metabolic syndrome).
- **5-year outcome**: ~20% achieve full recovery; ~50% have chronic relapsing course.

**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**
- Lifetime prevalence: ~6% of US adults (8% women, 4% men). Military personnel: ~13%.
- **Treatment gap**: <50% of returning veterans needing mental health services receive any treatment. Of those treated, <33% receive evidence-based care.
- Non-response rates: CBT ~50%; SSRIs ~20-40%. Overall, ~33% are treatment-resistant.
- Annual healthcare costs for US veterans with PTSD: 3.5x higher than those without.
- **Molecular basis**: HPA axis hyperactivation, amygdala hyperreactivity, prefrontal cortex hypofunction, epigenetic changes (DNA methylation of glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1).

**Substance Use Disorders**
- ~283 million people with alcohol use disorder (2019).
- ~36 million with drug use disorders.
- Opioid use disorders: ~16 million globally; ~80K overdose deaths/year in the US alone.
- **Treatment gap**: <10% of people with substance use disorders receive treatment globally.

### 1.6.3 Youth Mental Health Crisis

GBD 2021 reported a sharp increase in depression and anxiety among individuals aged 10-29 post-pandemic. Prevalence of any mental disorder among those <24 years is rising and projected to continue increasing through 2050. Suicide has re-entered the top 10 causes of death in the US.

## 1.7 AGE-STRATIFIED DISEASE INCIDENCE

### 1.7.1 How Disease Probability Changes with Age

Age is the single most powerful risk factor for most chronic diseases. The relationship is exponential, not linear.

**Cardiovascular Disease**
- Incidence rises exponentially between ages 40-80.
- Remaining lifetime risk at age 40: 34.8%.
- Remaining lifetime risk at age 90: 16.7%.
- CVD incidence continues to increase even to age 100.

**Cancer**
- Incidence rises exponentially from 40-80, peaks at age 80-89, then declines.
- Remaining lifetime risk at age 40: 45.1%.
- Remaining lifetime risk at age 90: 9.6%.
- Median age at cancer diagnosis: 66 years.

**Dementia/Alzheimer Disease**
- Prevalence doubles roughly every 5 years after age 65.
- Age 65-69: ~2% prevalence. Age 80-84: ~15%. Age 90+: ~35-50%.
- 9.84 million DALYs in 2021 (up from 3.83M in 1990).
- Projected to be 8th leading cause of death globally by 2050 (currently ~22nd).
- A new dementia case every 4 seconds. Projected 153 million cases by 2050.

**Type 2 Diabetes**
- Prevalence: ~3% at age 30, ~15% at age 60, ~25% at age 70+.
- Increasingly appearing in younger populations (obesity-driven).

### 1.7.2 The "Aging Diseases" -- Conditions Driven Primarily by Biological Aging

| Disease | Age relationship | Key aging mechanisms |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Atherosclerosis | Exponential, begins in teens | Endothelial senescence, oxidative damage, clonal hematopoiesis |
| Cancer (most types) | Exponential 40-80, plateau after | Somatic mutation accumulation, immune senescence, telomere erosion |
| Alzheimer disease | Exponential after 65 | Proteostasis failure (amyloid, tau), neuroinflammation, vascular damage |
| Parkinson disease | Mean onset 60; exponential rise 60-80 | Alpha-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, dopaminergic neuron vulnerability |
| Osteoarthritis | Near-universal by 70+ | Cartilage senescence, inflammaging, reduced chondrocyte regeneration |
| Osteoporosis | Accelerates post-menopause (women); age 70+ (men) | Osteoclast-osteoblast imbalance, estrogen decline, mTOR/AMPK dysregulation |
| Macular degeneration | Prevalence: 2% at 50, 30% at 80+ | RPE senescence, complement activation, drusen formation |
| Cataracts | Near-universal by 80+ | Crystallin aggregation, oxidative damage |
| Heart failure | Incidence doubles per decade after 65 | Cardiomyocyte senescence, fibrosis, impaired autophagy |
| Chronic kidney disease | Prevalence: 7% at 30-39, 38% at 65+ | Nephron loss, tubular senescence, vascular sclerosis |
| COPD | Peak prevalence 65-74 | Lung epithelial senescence, loss of elasticity, inflammaging |

### 1.7.3 The Hallmarks of Aging as Disease Drivers

The 12 hallmarks of aging (Lopez-Otin 2023) directly map to disease mechanisms:
1. **Genomic instability** -> Cancer
2. **Telomere attrition** -> Cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure
3. **Epigenetic alterations** -> Cancer, neurodegeneration
4. **Loss of proteostasis** -> Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, cataracts
5. **Disabled macroautophagy** -> Neurodegeneration, cancer
6. **Deregulated nutrient sensing** -> Diabetes, cancer, CVD
7. **Mitochondrial dysfunction** -> Parkinson's, heart failure, sarcopenia
8. **Cellular senescence** -> Atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, pulmonary fibrosis
9. **Stem cell exhaustion** -> Bone marrow failure, sarcopenia, impaired wound healing
10. **Altered intercellular communication** -> Inflammaging, cancer microenvironment
11. **Chronic inflammation** -> CVD, cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes
12. **Dysbiosis** -> IBD, metabolic syndrome, neuropsychiatric disorders

## 1.8 PEDIATRIC & DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS

### 1.8.1 Prevalence

- **Any developmental disability (US, ages 3-17)**: 16.65% (~1 in 6 children).
- **Autism spectrum disorder**: 2.94% (US, 2018-2021). 4.66% in boys vs. 1.50% in girls.
- **Intellectual disability**: 1.72% (US).
- **ADHD**: ~7-9% of children globally.
- **Cerebral palsy**: 1-3 per 1,000 live births.
- **Congenital heart defects**: ~1% of all live births (~8/1,000). Leading cause of infant mortality from non-communicable disease.
  - 180,624 CHD deaths in infants <1 year (2017).
  - CHD-associated child deaths declined 56.2% from 466K (1990) to 204K (2021) due to surgical advances.
- **Down syndrome**: ~1 in 700 live births (~6,000/year in US).
- **Cystic fibrosis**: ~1 in 3,400 live births.
- **Sickle cell disease**: 515,000 new births annually (mostly sub-Saharan Africa).

### 1.8.2 Where Early Intervention Transforms Outcomes

| Condition | Without early intervention | With early intervention |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **SMA (pre-symptomatic gene therapy)** | Fatal by age 2 (Type 1) | Near-normal motor development |
| **Congenital hypothyroidism** | Severe intellectual disability | Normal development with thyroid hormone |
| **PKU** | Severe intellectual disability | Normal development with dietary restriction |
| **Congenital hearing loss** | Language delay, social isolation | Normal language development with cochlear implant/hearing aid before 6 months |
| **Autism (intensive behavioral therapy by 18mo)** | More severe social/communication deficits | Significant IQ and adaptive behavior gains |
| **CHD (surgical correction in infancy)** | Heart failure, death | Near-normal life expectancy for many defects |
| **Retinopathy of prematurity** | Blindness | Preserved vision with laser/anti-VEGF |

### 1.8.3 Newborn Screening

- US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP): screens for ~35 core conditions.
- Whole genome sequencing in newborns is being piloted (BabySeq, Generation Study/UK).
- The opportunity: WGS could potentially identify hundreds of actionable conditions at birth vs. the current ~35.
- The challenge: variant interpretation (VUS), false positives, psychological burden on parents, equity of access.

## 1.9 NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES (NTDs)

### 1.9.1 Scale

- **21 conditions** recognized by WHO as NTDs.
- **1.495 billion people** required interventions in 2023 (32% decrease from 2010 baseline).
- ~1 billion people actively affected (2021).
- **14.1 million DALYs** (2021, down from 17.2M in 2015).
- **119,000 NTD-related deaths** annually (2021).
- **867 million people treated** in 2023 for at least one NTD.

### 1.9.2 The Most Burdensome NTDs

| Disease | People affected | Key facts |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Soil-transmitted helminths** (roundworm, hookworm, whipworm) | ~1.5 billion | Treatment: <$0.50/child/year via mass deworming |
| **Schistosomiasis** | ~240 million | Causes liver/bladder fibrosis; praziquantel effective but reinfection common |
| **Lymphatic filariasis** | ~51 million clinical cases | Causes elephantiasis; mass drug administration effective |
| **Trachoma** | ~137 million at risk | Leading infectious cause of blindness; SAFE strategy effective |
| **Chagas disease** | ~6-7 million | Causes cardiomyopathy; only 2 drugs available, both with significant side effects |
| **Leishmaniasis** | ~1 million new cases/year | Visceral form fatal without treatment; available drugs are toxic |
| **Dengue** | ~390 million infections/year | No effective antiviral; vaccine limited to seropositive individuals |
| **Rabies** | ~59,000 deaths/year | 100% fatal once symptomatic; post-exposure prophylaxis works but access is limited |
| **Snakebite** | 5.4 million bites/year, ~140K deaths | Antivenoms expensive, require cold chain, often unavailable |

### 1.9.3 Why They're Neglected

1. **Poverty of affected populations**: NTDs predominantly affect the poorest billion people who have no market power.
2. **No commercial incentive**: Pharmaceutical companies cannot recoup R&D investment from populations earning <$2/day.
3. **Political marginalization**: Affected populations often lack political voice.
4. **Overshadowed by HIV/TB/malaria**: MDGs prioritized the "big 3"; other infectious diseases were deprioritized.
5. **Fragile health systems**: Endemic countries lack infrastructure for surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment delivery.
6. **Research gap**: >40% of NTD systematic reviews lacked authors from endemic regions.

### 1.9.4 What Would Help Most

- **Scaling existing treatments**: Many NTDs have cost-effective treatments (mass drug administration costs <$0.50/person/year for helminths). The bottleneck is delivery, not drug availability.
- **Improved diagnostics**: Rapid, point-of-care, cold-chain-free diagnostics for field use.
- **New drug development**: Chagas, leishmaniasis, and snakebite need fundamentally better therapeutics.
- **Sustained funding**: Total annual NTD control budget: ~$2-3 billion needed; actual ODA spending: ~$200-300M. Recent ODA cuts have delayed campaigns affecting 143 million people.
- **Vaccines**: Only one NTD has a widely used vaccine (rabies, post-exposure). Dengue and Chagas vaccines are in development.

## 1.10 DISEASES WHERE EARLY DETECTION WOULD BE TRANSFORMATIVE

### 1.10.1 The Stage-Shift Opportunity

For many diseases, the difference between early and late detection is the difference between cure and death.

| Disease | Current detection | Achievable detection | Survival impact | Technology needed |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Pancreatic cancer** | 80% at Stage III/IV | Stage I/II via liquid biopsy + imaging | 3% -> 44% (5-yr) | Multi-cancer blood test, AI-analyzed CT/MRI |
| **Ovarian cancer** | 75% at Stage III/IV | Stage I via CA-125 longitudinal + STIC detection | <20% -> 89% (5-yr) | Better biomarkers, fallopian tube surveillance |
| **Lung cancer** | >50% at advanced stage | Stage I via low-dose CT | 7% -> ~60% (5-yr) | CT screening (already available, underutilized) |
| **Colorectal cancer** | ~40% at Stage III/IV without screening | Stage I via colonoscopy/FIT/ctDNA | 13% -> 91% (5-yr) | ctDNA screening for those who won't scope |
| **Hepatocellular carcinoma** | Often at advanced/unresectable | Early via AFP + ultrasound in at-risk | ~3% (advanced) -> ~35% (localized) | Better surveillance of HBV/HCV/cirrhosis patients |
| **Alzheimer disease** | At MCI/dementia (60-80% neuronal loss) | 15-20 years earlier via amyloid/tau PET or blood biomarkers | Unknown (no proven pre-symptomatic therapy yet) | p-tau217 blood test, amyloid PET |
| **Parkinson disease** | At motor symptoms (60-80% dopamine neurons lost) | 10-20 years earlier via alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay | Potentially transformative if neuroprotective therapies emerge | SAA assay, skin biopsy, DAT-SPECT |
| **Type 1 diabetes** | At DKA/hyperglycemia | 10+ years earlier via autoantibody screening | Teplizumab delays onset by ~2 years in at-risk | Autoantibody panels in children |
| **Chronic kidney disease** | Often at Stage 3-4 (>50% function lost) | Stage 1-2 via eGFR + albuminuria | SGLT2 inhibitors most effective when started early | Routine screening in at-risk populations |
| **Breast cancer** | Mammography detects 1-2cm tumors | Earlier via liquid biopsy, improved imaging | 99% (Stage I) vs. 31.9% (Stage IV) | AI-enhanced mammography, cfDNA screening |

### 1.10.2 Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED)

Liquid biopsy-based multi-cancer early detection is the most promising near-term technology for transforming cancer outcomes:

- **Galleri** (GRAIL): Screens for 50+ cancer types from a single blood draw. Specificity >99%. Sensitivity varies by stage: 17% (Stage I), 40% (Stage II), 77% (Stage III), 90% (Stage IV).
- **CancerSEEK**: Detects 8 common cancer types.
- **None yet FDA-approved** for screening (as of early 2026), though Galleri is available as a lab-developed test.
- The PATHFINDER trial found 1.4% cancer signal detection rate in asymptomatic adults 50+, with 38% of detected cancers having no other screening test available.
- Key challenge: Sensitivity for early-stage (Stage I) cancers remains low. The cancers you most want to catch early are the hardest to detect.

### 1.10.3 The Preclinical Window vs. Therapeutic Window

A critical distinction: **early detection is only transformative if matched with effective early intervention.**

- **Cervical cancer**: Early detection (Pap smear/HPV) + treatment (LEEP/excision) = near-total prevention. **Model success story.**
- **Colorectal cancer**: Colonoscopy + polypectomy = cancer prevention. **Model success story.**
- **Breast cancer**: Mammography + surgery/adjuvant therapy = dramatic survival improvement.
- **Alzheimer disease**: Early detection now possible (blood p-tau217), but no proven disease-modifying therapy for pre-symptomatic individuals. **Detection without intervention.**
- **Parkinson disease**: SAA assay can detect pre-motor PD, but no neuroprotective therapy proven. **Detection without intervention.**
- **Pancreatic cancer**: Even early-stage disease has only 44% 5-year survival. Better than 3%, but not a cure. **Partial benefit.**

The diseases with the largest early-detection opportunity gap and therapeutic readiness: **lung cancer** (LDCT underused), **colorectal cancer** (screening compliance ~60% in eligible US population), **cervical cancer** (HPV vaccination + screening could eliminate it globally but coverage is inadequate), **hepatocellular carcinoma** (surveillance of at-risk patients is inconsistent).

## 1.11 WHAT FRACTION OF DISEASES HAVE KNOWN CAUSES?

### 1.11.1 The Knowledge Spectrum

| Category | % of all diseases | Examples |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **Known monogenic cause** | ~5-8% of all diseases (but ~80% of rare diseases are genetic) | CF, sickle cell, Huntington's, hemophilia |
| **Known molecular mechanism (partial or full)** | ~40-50% of described genetic diseases have identified causal genes | -- |
| **Known environmental trigger** | ~15-20% (infectious agents, toxins, radiation) | HPV -> cervical cancer, H. pylori -> gastric cancer, asbestos -> mesothelioma |
| **Known risk factors but no single cause (multifactorial)** | ~60-70% of common diseases | T2 diabetes, hypertension, most cancers, CAD, depression |
| **Largely idiopathic** (mechanism unknown or poorly understood) | ~30-40% of all disease burden | Most psychiatric disorders, many autoimmune conditions, IBS, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, many cancers' initiating events |

### 1.11.2 Key Statistics

- Of >5,000 known genetic conditions, molecular basis is established for ~2,000 (~40%).
- ~50% of described Mendelian diseases have NOT been causally linked to a specific gene.
- Only ~20% of GWAS-identified risk loci have been functionally characterized.
- For most complex diseases, identified genetic variants explain only 10-30% of heritability ("missing heritability" problem).
- The vast majority of human disease burden is multifactorial/complex: genetics sets the probability, environment and stochasticity determine the outcome.
- **Idiopathic designations persist for**: most cases of ALS (~90% sporadic), Parkinson disease (~85-90% non-familial), major depression (no diagnostic biomarker), schizophrenia (highly heritable ~80% but mechanism unclear), most autoimmune diseases (genetic predisposition + unknown trigger), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (by definition), many pediatric cancers.

### 1.11.3 The Frontier

The most impactful knowledge gaps in disease mechanism:
1. **What triggers autoimmunity?** -- HLA genetics set the stage, but what pulls the trigger? Molecular mimicry? EBV? Gut microbiome shifts? Usually unknown.
2. **What triggers neurodegeneration?** -- We can describe the pathology (amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43) but rarely know why it starts when it does.
3. **What drives the adenoma-carcinoma transition?** -- We know the mutation sequence but not why some polyps progress and others don't.
4. **What causes treatment resistance?** -- In depression, schizophrenia, cancer, and many other diseases, we cannot predict who will respond to therapy.
5. **What determines disease severity variation?** -- Why does the same genetic mutation (e.g., in CF) produce vastly different clinical outcomes?

---

## 1.12 THE OBESITY PANDEMIC AS A DISEASE MULTIPLIER

A dedicated section because obesity is not merely one disease -- it is a **meta-risk factor** that amplifies the burden of nearly every NCD category.

- **>1 billion people** living with obesity globally (2024).
- Projection: 1.53 billion obese + 1.77 billion overweight by 2035 (54% of adults worldwide).
- **8.52% of all-cause deaths** are attributable to high BMI (2019).
- **5.89% of all global DALYs** attributable to high BMI.
- 78% of high-BMI deaths occur in LMICs.
- Obesity is a direct driver of: type 2 diabetes (RR ~7-10x), cardiovascular disease (RR ~2-3x), 13 types of cancer, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, NAFLD/NASH (now leading cause of liver transplant), PCOS, depression.
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists** (semaglutide, tirzepatide) represent a paradigm shift: 15-22% body weight reduction, with demonstrated CV mortality reduction (SELECT trial: -20% MACE). But cost (~$1,000/month) and access remain barriers.
