# Chapter 16: The China Model -- What a European Institute-Builder Can Learn from China's Biotech Ascent

**China's biopharmaceutical ecosystem has undergone the most rapid transformation in the history of the global drug industry. In 2015, Chinese companies accounted for single-digit percentages of global licensing deals. By 2025, one-third of all global drug licensing spending involved molecules originating in China. This chapter dissects how that happened -- the industrial policy, the talent pipeline, the speed advantages, the manufacturing scale, the specific companies -- and extracts the lessons that matter for someone building a drug-oriented research institute in Europe.**

*This is not a chapter about copying China. It is a chapter about understanding why a country that produced zero globally competitive innovative drugs in 2010 now produces molecules that AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and GSK are paying billions to license. The mechanisms behind that transformation contain principles that are geography-agnostic -- and Europe is currently failing to apply most of them.*

## 16.1 The Numbers That Should Alarm Europe

Before dissecting mechanisms, consider the raw trajectory.

### Deal Flow: The Exponential Curve

| Year | China Out-Licensing Deals | Total Deal Value (USD) | China Share of Global Licensing |
|------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2015 | ~55 | $3.1B | Single digits |
| 2020 | ~120 | $8.0B | ~10% |
| 2022 | ~150 | $28.0B | ~15% |
| 2023 | ~170 | $38.0B | ~21% |
| 2024 | 94 (out-licensing only) | $51.9B | ~28% of large pharma deals |
| 2025 | 157 (out-licensing only) | $135.7B | ~33% of all global licensing |

In H1 2025 alone, US companies signed 14 China-licensed deals worth approximately $18.3 billion, compared to just 2 such deals in H1 2024. The acceleration is not linear -- it is exponential.

### Landmark Deals That Define the Shift

The scale of individual transactions now rivals or exceeds deals between Western companies:

| Deal (Year) | Parties | Value | Asset |
|-------------|---------|-------|-------|
| GeneQuantum (2024-25) | Biohaven / AimedBio | $13.0B | ADC portfolio (TopoIx platform, 18 targets) |
| Hengrui / GSK (2025) | Hengrui / GlaxoSmithKline | $12.5B | 12 programs across respiratory, I&I, oncology |
| Innovent / Lilly (2026) | Innovent / Eli Lilly | $8.9B | Oncology and immunology pipeline (7th partnership) |
| 3SBio / Pfizer (2025) | 3SBio / Pfizer | $6.0B | SSGJ-707, PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody |
| Akeso / Summit (2023) | Akeso / Summit Therapeutics | $5.0B+ | Ivonescimab (PD-1/VEGF bispecific) |
| Legend / J&J (ongoing) | Legend Biotech / Johnson & Johnson | Ongoing royalties | Carvykti (BCMA CAR-T) |

The Hengrui/GSK deal deserves particular attention: $500 million upfront for up to 12 programs, with total biobucks of $12.5 billion. This is not a single molecule being licensed -- it is an entire pipeline being purchased from a Chinese innovator by a European pharma giant. GSK is effectively outsourcing a substantial portion of its future innovation to Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals.

### Clinical Trial Volume: China Now Leads

In 2024, China registered 7,100 clinical trials with the WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The United States registered approximately 6,000. For the first time in history, China conducted more clinical trials than America in a single year. The cumulative total still favors the US (197,090 vs. 163,704 between 1999 and mid-2025), but the trajectory is unmistakable.

### Pipeline Innovation: From Me-Too to First-in-Class

China now holds 24% of the world's first-in-class (FIC) drug pipeline, second only to the United States. FIC drug candidates originating in China rose from 9 in 2015 to 120 in 2024. In antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) alone, China leads globally with 812 planned and ongoing clinical trials versus 524 in the United States as of October 2025. In targeted protein degradation, China accounts for 38% of global publications and 37% of patents, with 400 granted TPD patents in 2024 compared to 187 for the United States.

China accounts for nearly 30% of global innovation pipeline assets, up from just 10% in 2019.

**The European contrast is stark.** Between 2010 and 2022, private pharmaceutical R&D expenditure in the EU, Switzerland, the UK, and Norway grew at 4.4% annually, rising from EUR 27.8 billion to EUR 46.2 billion. Chinese pharma R&D spending grew at 20.7% annually over the same period, reaching EUR 14.8 billion in 2022. US firms account for 55% of global pharma R&D spending; Europe has dropped to 26%. Europe is not falling behind -- it is being lapped, by both the US and China simultaneously.

**The lesson for Europe:** China's pharmaceutical industry was irrelevant to global drug innovation fifteen years ago. It is now the second-largest source of innovative collaboration for multinational pharma companies. This did not happen by accident.

## 16.2 Speed and Cost: The Structural Advantages

The most immediate competitive advantage Chinese biotechs hold over European and American competitors is not scientific quality -- it is velocity combined with cost efficiency. These two factors compound.

### Target-to-IND: Six Months vs. Two to Four Years

The timeline from compound discovery to IND (Investigational New Drug) filing in China has been compressed to approximately six months for leading companies. The Western industry average is 2.5 to 4 years. Insilico Medicine, using its AI platform, has benchmarked an average of 13 months from initial molecular library generation to preclinical candidate nomination across 22 programs -- but even this is slower than the fastest Chinese traditional drug discovery teams operating at scale.

Development from candidate nomination to regulatory approval can be 30% to 40% faster in China overall, saving up to four years to market.

### Clinical Trial Costs: 60-70% Lower

| Cost Component | United States | China | Ratio |
|---------------|--------------|-------|-------|
| Phase III per-patient cost (NSCLC) | ~$69,000 | ~$25,000 | 2.8x |
| Procedures/diagnostics/visits | Baseline | 30-40% lower | ~1.5x |
| Clinical personnel costs | Baseline | 50-70% lower | 2-3x |
| Hospital overhead / site fees | Baseline | 60-80% lower | 3-5x |

These are not marginal differences. A Phase III oncology trial that costs $150 million in the US can be run for $40-60 million in China, with equivalent or faster enrollment.

### Patient Recruitment: Population as Platform

A Phase I trial that takes two years to enroll in the United States can often be completed in nine months in China. The enrollment phase overall can be two to five times faster, driven by:

- **Treatment-naive patients.** A large pool of patients with limited prior access to innovative medicines makes them both eligible for trials and motivated to participate.
- **Geographic concentration.** China's urban population clusters around large hospitals, allowing single-site trials that would require multi-site logistics in Europe.
- **Tiered hospital system.** A coordinated network from Tier 3 urban centers to regional hospitals enables rapid, large-scale enrollment across multiple sites simultaneously.
- **Patient willingness.** Clinical trial participation is viewed as access to cutting-edge treatment, not as experimental risk-taking.

For a European institute-builder, this raises an uncomfortable question: if your drug candidate needs a 2,000-patient Phase III trial, and enrollment takes 24 months in Europe but 6 months in China, can you afford not to run your trial there?

### Regulatory Speed: The NMPA Transformation

Before 2015, China's drug regulatory system was notoriously slow, rigid, and opaque. The average NDA (New Drug Application) approval time was 21.4 months, with some applications languishing for 40 months. A series of reforms beginning in August 2015 transformed the system:

- **2015:** State Council issues "Opinions on the Reform of Review and Approval Process for Drugs and Medical Devices"
- **2017:** China's regulatory agency (then CFDA, now NMPA) joins ICH as a Regulatory Member, committing to international harmonization
- **2018:** 60-working-day clinical trial approval clock introduced; NMPA begins accepting foreign clinical data
- **2020-2025:** Conditional approval pathways, breakthrough therapy designations, priority review programs

**Result:** The median NDA approval time dropped from 21.4 months (2014-2016) to 6.8 months (late 2016 - early 2017) and stabilized at 15.4 months median across 2017-2021. For NDAs submitted under priority review or breakthrough therapy designation, approvals now routinely occur in under 12 months. In January 2025, the CDE proposed further reducing IND review timelines from 60 working days to 30 for qualifying innovative drugs.

**The lesson for Europe:** Regulatory reform is not abstract governance theory -- it is a competitive weapon. China compressed its approval timelines by 70% in five years through political will and institutional restructuring. The EMA's timelines, while reasonable, are not getting faster. A European institute-builder needs to understand that regulatory speed is part of the innovation equation. The EMA's Accelerated Assessment procedure reduces the review timeline from 210 to 150 days, but this applies only to products of major public health interest and requires pre-agreement. China's default IND timeline is now 60 days (and proposed to drop to 30), compared to the FDA's 30 days and the EMA's decentralized process that can stretch to months depending on the national authority involved.

## 16.3 The CDMO/CRO Powerhouse: Manufacturing as Strategy

China did not merely develop drug candidates -- it built the manufacturing infrastructure that the entire global pharmaceutical industry now depends on.

### WuXi Empire: Scale as Moat

**WuXi AppTec** reported 2024 revenue of RMB 39.2 billion (~$5.4 billion), with Q1 2025 revenue and profit resuming double-digit growth. North America represented 65% of revenue in 2023 (declining slightly in 2024 due to BIOSECURE concerns). The company is involved in one-quarter of all drugs commercialized in the United States.

**WuXi Biologics** reported 2024 revenue of CNY 18.7 billion (~$2.6 billion), with total backlog of $18.5 billion ($10.5 billion in service backlog plus $8.0 billion in potential milestones). WuXi Biologics ranks among the top three global biologics CDMOs alongside Lonza and Samsung Biologics.

**WuXi XDC** (antibody-drug conjugate specialist) has been a significant growth driver, reflecting the global ADC boom.

Together, the WuXi ecosystem touches virtually every phase of drug development -- from early discovery through commercial manufacturing -- for a significant fraction of Western pharmaceutical companies.

### The Broader Chinese CRO/CDMO Landscape

| Company | Focus | 2024 Revenue | Key Capability |
|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| WuXi AppTec | Integrated CRO/CDMO | ~$5.4B | Small molecule, cell/gene therapy |
| WuXi Biologics | Biologics CDMO | ~$2.6B | Monoclonal antibodies, bispecifics |
| Pharmaron | Integrated CRO/CDMO | ~$1.7B (RMB 12.3B) | Chemistry, biology, clinical |
| Asymchem | Small molecule CDMO | ~$873M | Chemical macromolecule CDMO |
| Medicilon | Preclinical CRO | Growing | Preclinical safety, PK/PD |
| ChemPartner | Discovery CRO | Growing | Target validation, lead optimization |

A Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) survey found that 79% of biopharmaceutical companies have a product or contract with a Chinese CDMO. This dependency is structural, not incidental.

### Global Biologics CDMO Comparison

| Company | 2024 Revenue | Bioreactor Capacity | Revenue Growth |
|---------|-------------|--------------------|--------------:|
| Lonza | ~$6.5B | 330,000L added (Roche acquisition) | Moderate |
| Samsung Biologics | ~$3.5B | 362,000L (full utilization) | 20%+ |
| WuXi Biologics | ~$2.6B | Large-scale global | ~10% |

Samsung Biologics won three $1 billion-plus multi-year contracts in H2 2024 alone, achieving 35%+ contract value growth. Lonza acquired one of the world's largest biologics manufacturing facilities from Roche for $1.2 billion in October 2024. The CDMO market is consolidating around scale -- and China holds significant positions.

### The BIOSECURE Act: Geopolitics Meets Supply Chain

The BIOSECURE Act, signed into law on December 18, 2025 as part of the FY2026 National Defense Authorization Act, prohibits federal agencies from contracting with designated "biotechnology companies of concern" (BCCs) or entities using their services. The original draft named WuXi AppTec, BGI Group, MGI, and Complete Genomics; an amended version added WuXi Biologics.

Key implications:

- US drugmakers have until **2032** to dissociate from designated companies
- WuXi AppTec blamed the Act for a 17% decline in its Advanced Therapies revenue through Q3 2024
- Moving established CDMO workflows to alternatives could take years
- Indian, European, and North American CDMOs are scrambling to absorb displaced capacity

**The lesson for Europe:** The BIOSECURE Act creates an enormous opportunity for European CDMOs. If 79% of biopharma companies need alternative manufacturing partners and have until 2032 to transition, European CDMO capacity expansion is not merely a good business -- it is a strategic imperative. Yet Europe faces its own manufacturing challenges: escalating energy costs (adding approximately EUR 1 billion in annual costs for generics manufacturers alone), experienced staff shortages (it takes a year or more to fully train new cell and gene therapy manufacturing staff), and limited large-scale biologics capacity compared to Asia. A European institute-builder should consider whether in-house or regional CDMO capability is part of the institutional design.

## 16.4 Government Industrial Policy: The State as Accelerator

China's biotech ascent was not a spontaneous market phenomenon. It was engineered through deliberate, sustained, multi-layered government intervention spanning decades.

### The Policy Architecture

**Made in China 2025 (2015):** Identified biopharmaceuticals and high-performance medical devices as pillar industries. Set explicit targets for domestic market share in innovative drugs and medical equipment.

**Healthy China 2030 (2016):** A national health strategy that positioned pharmaceutical innovation as integral to population health goals, creating demand-side pull for domestic innovation.

**14th Five-Year Plan for Bioeconomy Development (2021-2025):** The most specific policy instrument. Key elements:
- Promote integration of biotechnology and information technology
- Accelerate development of biotech and pharmaceuticals
- Increase the size and strength of China's bio-economy
- Three implementation pathways: technological innovation, industrialization, and policy support
- Target: significant increase in enterprises with annual bioeconomy revenues exceeding RMB 10 billion ($1.5 billion)

**15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030):** Continues the biotech emphasis, with biomanufacturing, quantum technology, and embodied intelligence identified as sectors to be "nurtured and scaled."

### National R&D Spending

China's total R&D expenditure exceeded RMB 3.61 trillion ($495 billion) in 2024, up 8.3% from 2023. R&D intensity (ratio to GDP) reached 2.69%, an increase of 0.11 percentage points year-over-year. While this aggregate figure covers all sectors, life sciences, materials science, and quantum technology are explicitly prioritized fields.

Annual investment in biomanufacturing alone has climbed to nearly RMB 30 billion ($4.29 billion) per year. The biomanufacturing industry has reached a total market size of RMB 1.1 trillion ($157.3 billion), with China accounting for over 70% of global biofermentation product output.

### The Biotech Hub Strategy

China did not distribute biotech investment evenly. It concentrated resources in purpose-built clusters, each with distinct specializations:

**Zhangjiang (Shanghai) -- "China's Pharma Valley":** Founded in 1992, Zhangjiang Science City covers 95 square kilometers and hosts over 1,700 biomedical companies, including local operations of Pfizer, Roche, and Novartis alongside domestic champions. New projects include the RMB 8 billion ($1.1 billion) "Zhangjiang Road" life sciences complex focused on antibody and cell/gene R&D. Vacancy rates in prime areas are moderate at 15%, with rents up to RMB 7.5/sqm/day.

**Suzhou BioBay:** Opened in 2007, commanding over RMB 100 billion ($14 billion) in guiding funds. Home to over 2,000 biomedical enterprises, including Innovent Biologics. Core park vacancy rates are low at 8%. Suzhou now leads the nation in innovative drug approvals.

**Beijing Zhongguancun:** Strong in genomics (BGI subsidiary operations), AI for drug discovery, and academic-industry translation from Peking University and Tsinghua University.

**Guangzhou / Shenzhen:** BGI Group headquarters (Shenzhen), growing cell therapy ecosystem, strong in diagnostics and sequencing technology.

**The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) Cluster:** Encompassing Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, this is China's most comprehensive biopharma ecosystem. Synthetic biology and biomanufacturing revenue in the region soared from RMB 29 billion ($4.06 billion) in 2022 to over RMB 90 billion ($12.62 billion) in 2024 -- a 213% increase in two years.

### Volume-Based Procurement (VBP): Domestic Pressure as Global Catalyst

The VBP policy, launched in November 2018 as the "4+7" centralized procurement program, is one of the most consequential and under-appreciated drivers of China's global pharmaceutical ambition. The mechanism is simple: the Chinese government aggregates purchasing volume for specific drugs and awards contracts to the lowest bidders, forcing massive price reductions.

**Impact by the numbers:**
- The 11th round of VBP (July 2025) covered 55 drugs across 14 therapeutic areas, including blockbusters like dapagliflozin and olaparib
- Average price reductions per VBP round: approximately 63%
- More than 40 generic manufacturers now bid for some molecules
- After NRDL (National Reimbursement Drug List) inclusion, drug utilization increases 3-12x and availability increases 1.5-4.5x

**The strategic consequence:** VBP made the Chinese domestic generic drug market brutally competitive and low-margin. This forced Chinese pharmaceutical companies to innovate or die. Companies that could not compete on generics pivoted to innovative drugs -- and the only way to achieve attractive pricing for innovative drugs was to sell them globally, outside the VBP system.

In 2024, domestic companies secured 71% of new NRDL listings. The negotiation success rate for "global new" innovative drugs (first launched globally in China) exceeded 90%. But the price pressure means that even innovative drugs face margin compression in the domestic market. The rational economic response: develop innovative drugs and license them to Western pharma for Western-market pricing.

**VBP effectively turned China's 1.4-billion-person domestic market into an innovation forcing function.** Companies like BeiGene, Hengrui, and Innovent did not pursue global markets because they wanted to -- they pursued them because VBP made the domestic market insufficient to fund the next generation of R&D.

**The lesson for Europe:** Europe's fragmented procurement systems across 27+ member states create neither the volume leverage of China's VBP nor the innovation pressure it generates. A European institute-builder should understand that market design is an innovation tool: the structure of how drugs are purchased and reimbursed directly shapes what gets invented.

## 16.5 The Talent Engine: STEM at Scale

### PhD Production: The Numbers Gap

| Metric | China | United States | Europe (EU-27) |
|--------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| STEM PhDs per year (2022) | 50,000+ | ~34,000 | ~60,000 (est.) |
| STEM PhDs projected (2025) | 77,000+ | ~40,000 | N/A |
| Ratio to US | 1.9x | 1.0x | ~1.5x |
| Total researchers employed | Largest globally | Second | Combined: less than China |

China awarded over 50,000 STEM doctorates in 2022, more than double its 2007 total and the year it first overtook the United States. By 2025, Chinese universities are projected to produce more than 77,000 STEM PhD graduates annually -- nearly double the US output. China now employs more researchers than both America and the entire European Union combined.

### The "Sea Turtle" Phenomenon

The haigui (literally "sea returnees," a homophone of "sea turtles") are returning Chinese scientists trained at Western institutions. The numbers are staggering: of the approximately 2 million haiguis who returned between roughly 2010 and 2020, an estimated 250,000 work in the life sciences. Over 140 returnee-led biotech companies were founded in China in this period, many by researchers trained at American institutions in oncology and gene therapy.

The returnees bring two things that cannot be taught domestically: familiarity with Western drug development processes and regulatory expectations, and personal networks connecting Chinese operations to US and European pharma. BeiGene, Innovent Biologics, and Hua Medicine were all founded by haiguis.

### Government Recruitment Programs

The Thousand Talents Plan (launched 2008) attracted more than 7,000 senior scientists within its first decade. Broader talent recruitment programs drew in almost 60,000 professionals between 2008 and 2016. The Young Thousand Talents (YTT) program, started in 2010, offered more than 3,500 researchers under 40 funding and benefits to relocate full-time to China.

**Measured impact:** YTT scientists produced 27% more publications than their overseas peers after returning. The impact was largest in resource-intensive fields -- chemistry, life sciences, and engineering -- where returnees outperformed because of access to larger research teams and better funding in China.

### Nature Index: Research Quality Catching Up

The Nature Index 2025 Research Leaders tells a dramatic story:

- Nine of the world's top ten academic institutions by high-quality research output are now Chinese (Harvard is the sole exception)
- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has maintained the #1 global position for 13 consecutive years
- China's contribution exhibited a 17% increase compared to 2023 -- the highest growth rate among the top 20 countries
- The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) ranked second worldwide with 2,585 papers
- Zhejiang University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University all placed in the global top ten

In life sciences specifically, China's position is weaker but improving: Zhejiang University entered the biological sciences top 10 for the first time in 2024, and Sun Yat-sen University holds 7th place in health sciences.

### BGI: Talent at Industrial Scale

BGI Group (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute) represents a uniquely Chinese approach to scientific talent development -- training through industrial-scale production. Founded in 1999 to participate in the Human Genome Project, BGI is now the world's largest center for gene sequencing research. Its subsidiary MGI Tech developed the DNBSEQ sequencing platform, which has surpassed 3,900 installations worldwide and contributed to over 10,900 scientific publications.

BGI achieved $100 whole-genome sequencing in 2020 and sub-$100 sequencing with the DNBSEQ-T20x2 in 2023. The model is fundamentally different from Western genomics companies: BGI functions as a training pipeline where thousands of young scientists learn genomics through performing sequencing at scale, then disperse into the broader Chinese biotech ecosystem carrying practical skills.

**The lesson for Europe:** Europe's talent problem is not quality -- it is retention and scale. European universities produce excellent biologists, but they leave for American institutions or industry at disproportionate rates. China solved its brain drain through a combination of financial incentives (Thousand Talents), infrastructure investment (purpose-built research hubs), and a rapidly growing domestic industry that offers exciting career opportunities. A European institute-builder needs a talent strategy that addresses all three: compensation competitive with pharma, world-class infrastructure, and a compelling institutional mission.

## 16.6 AI + Biotech: The Chinese Convergence

### The "Four Little Dragons" and Beyond

China's AI-for-drug-discovery ecosystem has produced several companies now attracting billion-dollar deals:

**XtalPi** -- Founded in 2014 by MIT alumni, XtalPi blends quantum physics, cloud computing, and robotics. Revenue jumped 53% to RMB 266 million in 2024, with 73% growth in H2. The company signed a $250 million collaboration with Eli Lilly in 2023 and a landmark $6-10 billion codevelopment partnership with US pharma DoveTree in 2024 for multiple AI-designed drug candidates. 40% of revenue comes from selling automation tools to global clients.

**Insilico Medicine** -- Listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on December 30, 2025 (stock code 03696.HK), raising $293 million in Hong Kong's largest biotech IPO of 2025. Its lead candidate, rentosertib (ISM001-055), a TNIK inhibitor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, showed positive Phase IIa results published in Nature Medicine (June 2025). Insilico's platform has nominated 22 preclinical candidates since 2021, with an average of 13 months from molecular library generation to preclinical candidate -- versus the 2.5-4 year industry average. Revenue reached approximately $85.8 million in 2024, with a broader pipeline of 31 programs and 10 IND-approved assets.

**MindRank, PharmaMolix, Galixir** -- Earlier-stage Chinese AI-drug companies that are building platform capabilities in molecular property prediction, generative chemistry, and target identification.

### The DeepSeek Effect

DeepSeek's emergence in January 2025 demonstrated something profound about China's AI capability: the ability to produce frontier AI models at a fraction of Western costs. DeepSeek's large language model was reportedly trained for under $6 million, compared to the hundreds of millions spent on GPT-4. While DeepSeek is not a biotech company, its implications for Chinese AI-driven drug discovery are significant:

- It validated that China can achieve state-of-the-art AI performance with cost-efficient approaches
- Its open-source release accelerated AI adoption across Chinese biotech startups
- It demonstrated the resilience of Chinese AI development despite US chip export restrictions
- Drug makers and biotechs can leverage these foundation models for molecular analysis, protein interaction prediction, and clinical data analysis at dramatically lower cost

### Tech Giants as Biotech Investors

Chinese tech giants are not just investing in AI-biotech -- they are building platform capabilities:

**Tencent** developed iDrug, an AI-driven platform for preclinical drug research based on deep learning algorithms. Tencent was also an early backer of XtalPi (alongside SoftBank), directly connecting consumer tech capital to drug discovery.

**Baidu, Alibaba, and ByteDance** are backing AI-biotech startups across the ecosystem, providing both capital and computational infrastructure.

**Government AI for Health Initiatives:** AI drug discovery was formally named a priority in China's Five-Year Plan for 2025, triggering local governments in pharmaceutical hubs like Shanghai to inject additional funding into AI-biotech ventures.

**The lesson for Europe:** Europe has strong AI research institutions (DeepMind in London, EPFL in Switzerland, Max Planck in Germany) but has struggled to connect AI capability to drug discovery at scale. China's advantage is not AI quality per se -- it is the speed with which AI capability is deployed in pharmaceutical applications, backed by government incentive structures and tech-giant capital. A European institute-builder should consider AI-driven drug discovery not as a separate department but as an embedded capability across all programs.

## 16.7 Company Profiles: From Nothing to Global Competitors

### BeiGene (BeOne Medicines): The Flagship

**Founded:** 2010 by John Oyler (American entrepreneur) and Xiaodong Wang (haigui scientist, former UT Southwestern Howard Hughes Investigator)

**The zanubrutinib story:** BeiGene's BTK inhibitor Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) is now the global market leader in new chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient starts in the United States -- displacing AbbVie's ibrutinib, a drug developed by Pharmacyclics and originally partnered with Johnson & Johnson.

**Financial trajectory:**

| Year | Total Revenue | Brukinsa Revenue | Key Milestone |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 2023 | ~$2.5B | ~$1.3B | Rapid US growth |
| 2024 | ~$3.8B (+55%) | ~$2.6B (+105%) | US sales reach $2.0B |
| Q1 2025 | ~$1.1B (+47%) | ~$770M (70% of sales) | First quarterly GAAP profit |
| 2025 guidance | $4.9-5.3B | Continued growth | Positive GAAP operating income |

BeiGene European sales reached $359 million in 2024 and are growing rapidly. The company rebranded to BeOne Medicines in 2025 to reflect its global identity.

**Why it matters for Europe:** BeiGene proved that a China-founded company can develop a drug that outcompetes Western incumbents in the US market on clinical data, achieve #1 market share in its indication, and build a global commercial organization. It was not competing on price -- it was competing on efficacy and tolerability data from well-designed global clinical trials. If a Chinese company can do this, a well-designed European institute with the right translational infrastructure can do it too.

### Legend Biotech: CAR-T That Beat the West

**The Carvykti story:** Legend Biotech, founded in Nanjing, developed a BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy (ciltacabtagene autoleucel, marketed as Carvykti) that is now one of the most important cancer therapies in the world.

- 2024 global sales: $963 million (just under blockbuster threshold)
- 2025 projected sales: $1.7 billion
- Peak global sales estimate: $7.2 billion by 2030
- Over 9,000 clinical and commercial patients treated to date
- FDA broadened label in April 2024 to include patients with just one prior line of therapy

Legend's partnership with Johnson & Johnson for global commercialization is instructive: a Chinese biotech developed the science, an American pharma giant provided the global commercial and manufacturing infrastructure. In 2025, clinical production of Carvykti began at a new facility in Belgium, with commercial production expected by year-end -- bringing Chinese-invented cell therapy manufacturing to European soil.

### Hengrui Medicine: China's Largest Pharma Innovator

Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals has commercialized 23 new molecular entity drugs and 4 other innovative drugs in China. Its 2025 trajectory includes:

- $12.5 billion GSK deal (12 programs across respiratory, immunology/inflammation, oncology)
- $200 million upfront payment from Merck & Co. for a Phase 2 heart disease candidate
- Hong Kong IPO raising HK$9.89 billion ($1.29 billion) in May 2025
- GLP-1/GIP receptor dual agonist for weight loss approaching Chinese regulatory submission

Hengrui is the archetype of the "China-for-global" strategy: a company built on domestic market dominance in generics and early innovative drugs, now licensing its pipeline to Western pharma at valuations that would have been unthinkable five years ago.

### Innovent Biologics: The Lilly Bridge

Innovent's trajectory illustrates both the opportunity and the complexity of China-global drug development:

- **Sintilimab (Tyvyt):** PD-1 antibody developed with Eli Lilly. Successfully launched in China and included in the NRDL. However, Lilly's US FDA filing was rejected in 2022 (complete response letter citing concerns about single-country trial data from China), and the US program was subsequently abandoned.
- **Lesson learned:** Innovent pivoted to generating global clinical data and building a diversified pipeline. Total product revenue reached approximately RMB 11.9 billion ($1.7 billion) in 2025, a 45% increase from 2024.
- **Seventh Lilly partnership (February 2026):** $350 million upfront, up to $8.5 billion in milestones, for a new oncology and immunology pipeline -- demonstrating that the sintilimab setback did not destroy the relationship.

The sintilimab FDA rejection is a cautionary tale for any company (Chinese or European) attempting to gain global approval based solely on single-country data. The lesson: global clinical programs require global clinical data.

### Akeso: The Bispecific Antibody Pioneer

Akeso developed cadonilimab, the world's first approved immuno-oncology bispecific antibody (PD-1/CTLA-4), now approved for cervical cancer and gastric cancer. Its second major asset, ivonescimab (PD-1/VEGF bispecific), was licensed to Summit Therapeutics for over $5 billion -- the highest single-molecule out-licensing transaction from China at the time. Akeso has been described as biotech's "DeepSeek moment" -- a Chinese company producing a drug that could outperform established Western competitors in head-to-head trials.

H1 2025 commercial sales: RMB 1.4 billion, up 49% year-over-year. Akeso is executing a dual-path strategy: accelerating domestic commercialization while advancing global development through the Summit partnership. Its global Phase II trial for cadonilimab in hepatocellular carcinoma has been approved by both NMPA and FDA.

### Zai Lab: The In-Licensing Bridge Model

Zai Lab represents a different Chinese biotech strategy: rather than developing molecules internally and licensing them out, Zai Lab licenses Western drugs in and commercializes them in Greater China. Total revenues grew 50% to $399 million in 2024, with 2025 guidance of $560-590 million and a target of $2 billion by 2028. The VYVGART franchise (licensed from Argenx for generalized myasthenia gravis) and KarXT (licensed from Karuna/BMS for schizophrenia) are key growth drivers. Zai Lab is advancing toward profitability, expected in Q4 2025.

However, Zai Lab is increasingly developing its own global assets: ZL-1310 (DLL3 ADC with global rights) in small cell lung cancer represents the company's evolution from pure in-licenser to originator of global molecules.

### CanSino Biologics: Platform Versatility

CanSino was among the first companies globally to begin clinical testing of a COVID-19 vaccine, moving into clinical trials in March 2020 alongside Moderna. Post-pandemic, CanSino has pivoted its mRNA manufacturing capability into a platform business: a 10-year supply agreement with AstraZeneca to manufacture mRNA vaccines, using CanSino's Shanghai facility capable of producing 200 million vaccine doses annually. In February 2025, CanSino's globally pioneering DTcP-Hib-MCV4 combined vaccine received clinical trial approval -- integrating five vaccine components into a single product. This versatility -- from adenoviral vectors to mRNA manufacturing to combination vaccines -- illustrates the platform thinking that characterizes the best Chinese biotechs.

## 16.8 The "China-for-Global" Strategic Shift

The most important conceptual transformation in Chinese pharma over the past five years is the shift from "China-for-China" to "China-for-global."

### Phase 1 (2000-2015): Copy and Supply

Chinese companies manufactured generic APIs and finished dosage forms for domestic consumption. Contract manufacturing (early WuXi model) served Western drug companies. Innovation was minimal. The value capture was in cost arbitrage.

### Phase 2 (2015-2020): Fast Follower

Regulatory reform (ICH membership, NMPA restructuring) enabled Chinese companies to develop "me-too" versions of successful Western drugs for the Chinese market. PD-1 antibodies are the archetypal example: at one point, over 30 PD-1 programs were running in China simultaneously. This created brutal domestic competition but also built clinical development capability at scale.

### Phase 3 (2020-2025): License Out

Chinese companies began licensing their innovative molecules to Western pharma companies for development and commercialization outside China. The deal flow exploded: from $3.1 billion in 2015 to $135.7 billion in 2025. The value proposition: Chinese biotechs could deliver clinical-stage molecules with compelling data at a fraction of Western R&D costs.

### Phase 4 (2025+): Global Innovator

The current transition. Companies like BeiGene are not licensing their drugs -- they are commercializing them globally through their own sales organizations. BeiGene achieved $2.0 billion in US Brukinsa sales in 2024 through its own commercial team. This is the most threatening phase for Western pharma: Chinese companies competing directly in Western markets, not as suppliers or licensors, but as integrated pharmaceutical companies.

**Where Europe fits:** European pharma companies are increasingly positioned as customers of Chinese innovation, licensing molecules from Chinese biotechs for European commercialization. GSK paid $500 million upfront to Hengrui. AstraZeneca invested $2.5 billion in Beijing in March 2025 for its sixth global strategic R&D center. Novo Nordisk, Roche, and Novartis all have substantial Chinese R&D operations. This is the opposite of the relationship Europe should aspire to. A European institute-builder must understand that being a buyer of Chinese innovation is not the same as being an innovator.

Consider the asymmetry: when a Chinese company licenses a molecule to a European pharma company, the Chinese company retains IP, collects royalties, and builds capability for the next molecule. The European company gets one product. Over time, the Chinese company's capability compounds while the European company's dependency deepens. This is a structural dynamic that Europe needs to reverse -- not through protectionism, but through building its own translational infrastructure that generates licensable molecules at competitive speed and cost.

## 16.9 What Europe Should Learn: The Transferable Principles

### Principle 1: Speed of Decision-Making (Government + Industry Alignment)

China's biotech acceleration was enabled by alignment between government policy (Five-Year Plans, VBP, NMPA reform), capital allocation (hub investment, guiding funds), and industry strategy (global expansion). Decisions that take years of multi-stakeholder negotiation in Europe (regulatory reform, infrastructure investment, procurement policy) were executed in months in China.

**European application:** The EU's fragmented regulatory landscape (27 national competent authorities plus the EMA), multiple procurement systems, and consensus-driven governance are structural impediments to speed. A European institute should not wait for systemic reform -- it should design its own institutional architecture for rapid decision-making, including pre-negotiated regulatory pathways, streamlined IP processes, and executive authority concentrated in scientific leadership.

### Principle 2: Scale Thinking

China routinely operates at population scale. The VBP program covers 1.4 billion people. Clinical trials enroll thousands of patients from dense urban hospitals. BGI sequences genomes at industrial volume. Manufacturing facilities are built for continental demand.

Europe's biotech ecosystem operates at national or sub-national scale. A Danish biotech company, a French CRO, and a German CDMO operate in separate regulatory, linguistic, and commercial environments. The European Medicines Agency provides a unified regulatory pathway, but everything else -- clinical trial networks, procurement, manufacturing -- is fragmented.

**European application:** A European institute-builder should think in terms of pan-European scale from day one. Clinical trial networks that span 10+ countries. Manufacturing partnerships that serve the entire European market. Procurement agreements that aggregate demand across borders. The infrastructure for this exists (ECRIN for clinical trials, EIT Health for innovation) but is underutilized.

### Principle 3: Manufacturing as Strategic Capability

China invested in CDMO/CRO infrastructure before the demand fully materialized. WuXi was building capacity when Western pharma companies were outsourcing on the margin. The result: when the outsourcing wave hit, Chinese CDMOs had the capacity, and Western alternatives did not.

Europe faces an acute CDMO gap. Energy costs are adding approximately EUR 1 billion in annual incremental costs for generics manufacturers alone. Cell and gene therapy CDMOs face capability shortages more than capacity shortages -- it takes a year or more to fully train new staff. The BIOSECURE Act creates an opportunity: displaced manufacturing could flow to Europe if capacity exists.

**European application:** A drug-oriented European institute should consider integrated manufacturing capability -- not as a cost center, but as a strategic asset. Even a small GMP facility for early-phase clinical supply would accelerate translational timelines and reduce dependency on external CDMOs with 12-18 month wait times.

### Principle 4: Talent Pipeline Engineering

China engineered its talent pipeline through multiple channels simultaneously: mass STEM PhD production (77,000+ per year by 2025), targeted recruitment of diaspora scientists (Thousand Talents, YTT), industrial training at scale (BGI model), and purpose-built research hubs that offer competitive infrastructure and funding.

Europe produces excellent scientists but exports them. The United States, Switzerland, and (increasingly) China offer more competitive compensation, better-funded labs, and faster career progression. European postdocs are among the most skilled and least well-paid researchers in the world.

**European application:** A European institute must offer compensation and career structures competitive with both pharma and top US institutions. This means salaries above academic norms, equity or equity-equivalent participation in spinouts, multi-year guaranteed funding, and a clear pathway from junior researcher to independent investigator that does not require a decade of postdoctoral limbo.

### Principle 5: Competing on Price AND Quality Simultaneously

The most dangerous misconception about Chinese pharma is that it competes only on cost. BeiGene's Brukinsa did not win US market share because it was cheaper -- it won because head-to-head clinical trial data showed superior tolerability compared to ibrutinib. Legend's Carvykti did not succeed because it was less expensive -- it succeeded because the five-year survival data in multiple myeloma was unprecedented.

Chinese companies use cost advantages in R&D and manufacturing to fund more and larger clinical trials, which generate better data, which enables premium pricing in global markets. Cost efficiency is not the product -- it is the engine that drives product quality.

**European application:** A European institute should not apologize for seeking cost efficiency. Lower overhead, efficient clinical operations, and streamlined manufacturing are not compromises on quality -- they are enablers of it. Every euro saved on administrative overhead is a euro available for an additional arm in a clinical trial or an additional patient in a study.

### Principle 6: The Fast Follower to First Mover Transition

China's trajectory from generics manufacturer to first-in-class innovator took approximately 15 years. The transition was not smooth or linear -- it involved massive waste (30+ simultaneous PD-1 programs), painful market consolidation (VBP), and notable failures (sintilimab's FDA rejection). But the end state is clear: China now holds 24% of the world's first-in-class pipeline, produces 120+ FIC candidates annually, and leads the world in ADC and TPD patent filings.

**European application:** Europe does not need to follow the same path. Europe already has first-mover scientific capability (CRISPR was co-invented in Europe, mRNA vaccine technology was developed at BioNTech in Germany, antibody engineering has deep European roots at MRC-LMB). What Europe lacks is the translational infrastructure to convert first-mover science into first-mover drugs at speed and scale. A European institute should start at the frontier -- not at the fast-follower stage -- and build the translational pipeline that China had to develop over fifteen years.

## 16.10 Risks and Honest Assessment: What the China Model Does Not Solve

This chapter is framed as "what Europe can learn from China," but intellectual honesty requires acknowledging what the China model does not solve, and the risks embedded in its approach.

### Intellectual Property and Data Integrity Concerns

IP concerns regarding Chinese biotech have evolved but not disappeared. US intelligence officials reportedly briefed lawmakers that WuXi AppTec was passing along US partners' intellectual property data to the Chinese government -- an allegation the company denies. The FDA has taken action against Chinese third-party testing firms (Mid-Link and SDWH in September 2024) for data falsification and laboratory oversight failures. Data integrity violations have led to warning letters, import alerts, and consent decrees, particularly at facilities in China and India.

These are not endemic to Chinese biotech -- data integrity issues exist globally. But the frequency of FDA actions involving Chinese facilities creates real due diligence costs for any Western company or institution partnering with Chinese organizations.

**For a European institute:** The lesson is not "avoid China" but "build robust data integrity infrastructure from day one." The reputational cost of a data integrity failure is existential for a young institution.

### Data Governance and Cross-Border Restrictions

China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), implemented in November 2021, treats genetic data as sensitive when it qualifies as biometric or health-related. More restrictively, the Human Genetic Resources (HGR) regulations require notification filing before transmitting clinical trial data to foreign regulatory agencies. Genomic data generated in the medical sector can only be stored on servers within China, significantly restricting international data transfer.

These restrictions create real barriers to global clinical development. A clinical trial run in China that generates genomic data may face legal obstacles to sharing that data with European or American regulatory authorities.

**For a European institute:** Europe's GDPR is stringent but navigable. The lesson from China's HGR regulations is that data governance architecture should be designed before clinical programs begin, not retrofitted afterward. A European institute conducting trials with Chinese partners needs clear data flow agreements that comply with both GDPR and Chinese data localization requirements.

### Geopolitical Risk: The US-China Decoupling

The BIOSECURE Act is one manifestation of a broader US-China decoupling in biotechnology. The Act gives US drugmakers until 2032 to dissociate from designated Chinese companies. If fully enforced, this could fundamentally reshape global pharmaceutical supply chains.

For Chinese biotechs, the risk is real: if US market access narrows, the economic rationale for global innovation (develop in China, sell globally at premium prices) weakens. WuXi's Advanced Therapies division already experienced a 17% revenue decline linked to BIOSECURE uncertainty.

**For a European institute:** Geopolitical risk creates opportunity. Europe is not the United States -- it can maintain independent relationships with Chinese biotech while also serving as a neutral manufacturing and clinical development partner for companies navigating US-China tensions. A European institute positioned as a bridge between Chinese innovation and global markets could capture significant value.

### Quality Concerns and Regulatory Scrutiny

The sheer speed of China's biotech expansion has inevitably produced quality issues. The FDA's complete response letter for sintilimab raised concerns about relying on single-country clinical data. FDA import alerts and warning letters targeting Chinese manufacturing facilities remain a regular occurrence. The 30+ simultaneous PD-1 programs that ran in China produced massive redundancy and waste alongside genuine innovation.

**For a European institute:** Speed and quality are in tension but not incompatible. The Chinese experience shows that regulatory scrutiny increases with ambition -- the more Chinese companies try to access global markets, the more they encounter FDA and EMA quality expectations. A European institute starting with global regulatory standards from day one avoids the painful quality upgrade that Chinese companies are currently navigating.

### Sustainability of the Model

China's biotech venture capital funding peaked at $15.7 billion in 2021 before plunging to $4.2 billion in 2024. Many Chinese biotech startups now use licensing deals as alternative financing channels because traditional fundraising has become difficult. The domestic market, squeezed by VBP price pressure, offers limited revenue potential for innovative drugs. If US market access narrows and venture funding remains constrained, the sustainability of China's biotech model depends on whether European and other global markets can absorb the innovation output.

China's biotech industry still represents just 4.8% of the global market in 2024, compared to 35% for the US and 31% for Europe. The market share does not yet match the innovation output -- which suggests that the full commercial impact of China's biotech revolution is still ahead of us, not behind us.

**For a European institute:** Do not build a model that depends on a single source of funding or a single market for revenue. Diversification -- across funding sources, revenue streams, and geographic markets -- is the best hedge against the kind of funding volatility that is currently stressing Chinese biotechs. The silver lining for Europe: China's funding contraction means that Chinese biotechs are increasingly open to partnerships with European institutions and companies -- partnerships that would have been impossible to negotiate three years ago when domestic capital was abundant.

## 16.11 Synthesis: The European Institute-Builder's China Playbook

The China model, stripped of its geopolitical context and authoritarian governance structure, reveals a set of principles that any ambitious institution-builder should internalize:

### What to Replicate

1. **Speed as a design principle.** Build institutional processes that prioritize velocity. Target-to-IND in 18 months, not 48. This requires parallel workstreams, empowered decision-makers, and pre-established regulatory pathways.

2. **Scale thinking from day one.** Design clinical programs for pan-European or global enrollment. Build manufacturing partnerships that serve continental demand. Think in thousands of patients, not dozens.

3. **Talent acquisition as a strategic function.** Hire a dedicated team for talent recruitment. Offer compensation competitive with pharma. Create pathways for international scientists (Europe's equivalent of the haigui phenomenon). Build relationships with diaspora networks.

4. **Manufacturing capability as institutional infrastructure.** Even small-scale GMP capacity accelerates timelines by 12-18 months and reduces dependency on external CDMOs. The BIOSECURE-driven reshoring trend creates a window for European CDMO investment.

5. **Market pressure as innovation driver.** Partner with procurement systems that demand evidence of value. Engage with health technology assessment bodies (NICE, G-BA, HAS) early. Use reimbursement requirements as program design constraints, not post-hoc obstacles.

6. **AI integration as standard practice.** Embed computational drug design, molecular simulation, and data-driven clinical trial optimization into every program. China's AI-biotech companies are not separate from its drug companies -- they are embedded in them.

### What Not to Replicate

1. **State-directed research priorities.** China's Five-Year Plans choose winners and losers. This produces strategic alignment but also massive waste (30 PD-1 programs). A European institute should have intellectual freedom to pursue high-risk, high-reward targets that no government would prioritize.

2. **Data governance that restricts international collaboration.** China's HGR regulations are designed for national security, not scientific efficiency. A European institute should build data infrastructure that enables global collaboration by default, with privacy protections that are rigorous but not isolating.

3. **Growth at any cost.** China's biotech boom included companies with weak science, unsustainable burn rates, and dubious data. The subsequent funding contraction ($15.7B to $4.2B in venture capital) is a correction. Quality-first growth is slower but more durable.

4. **Dependence on a single market for innovation economics.** Chinese biotechs developed innovative drugs because VBP made generics unprofitable and US market pricing made innovation lucrative. If US market access narrows, the model is stressed. Build for multiple markets from inception.

### The Opportunity Window

Europe stands at a unique moment. The US-China decoupling is reshuffling global pharmaceutical supply chains. The BIOSECURE Act is forcing companies to find alternative CDMO partners. Chinese biotechs are seeking non-US markets for their innovative molecules. Western pharma companies need manufacturing capacity outside both China and the US.

Europe -- with its strong scientific base, EMA regulatory framework, universal healthcare systems that provide built-in reimbursement pathways, and geographic position between the US and Asian markets -- is the natural beneficiary of this reshuffling. But only if it builds the institutional infrastructure to absorb the opportunity.

A drug-oriented European research institute, designed with the speed, scale, and translational discipline that China's ecosystem demonstrates, and grounded in the scientific quality and intellectual freedom that Europe already possesses, would not merely be competitive. It would be the institution that the next generation of global drug innovation flows through.

The question is not whether such an institution can exist. China proved that an entire national pharmaceutical ecosystem can be built in fifteen years. The question is whether Europe has the ambition and the institutional courage to build one.

*The China model is not a template to copy. It is a mirror in which Europe can see its own structural weaknesses -- fragmentation, slowness, risk aversion, manufacturing dependency, talent export -- reflected at continental scale. The companies and policies described in this chapter did not succeed because they were Chinese. They succeeded because they solved real problems: speed, cost, talent, scale, regulatory efficiency, and the alignment of incentives toward innovation. Every one of those problems has a European solution. The question is whether anyone will build it.*
