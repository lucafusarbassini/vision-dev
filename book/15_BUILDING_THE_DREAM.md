# Chapter 15: Building the Dream -- Founding a Drug-Oriented Research Institute in Europe

**A concrete blueprint for building something that does not yet exist: an institution that combines the intellectual freedom of the Arc Institute with the translational discipline of pharma, rooted in European soil, aimed at diseases the market ignores.**

*This chapter is for the reader who has absorbed everything in the preceding fourteen chapters and is now asking the question: what if I built the institution myself?*

## 15.1 The Arc Institute Model: What Works and What's Missing

The Arc Institute, launched in December 2021 by Stanford biochemist Silvana Konermann, UC Berkeley bioengineer Patrick Hsu, and Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, represents the most ambitious recent attempt to reimagine how science is funded and conducted. Understanding what Arc gets right -- and what it deliberately leaves out -- is essential groundwork for designing something more drug-oriented.

### What Arc Gets Right

**Funding architecture.** Arc's founding donors committed over $650 million to sustain the institute. This is not grant money parceled out in 3-year increments -- it is a war chest designed to let scientists think in decades. Core Investigators receive renewable eight-year appointments with full salary and research support, eliminating the grant-writing treadmill that consumes 40-50% of a typical academic PI's time.

**Governance independence.** Patrick Collison is a co-founder and founding donor, but holds no operating role. The scientific advisory board includes Carolyn Bertozzi and Aviv Regev. The board of directors includes Nat Friedman, Reid Hoffman, and Meta CFO Susan Li. This separation of donor influence from scientific direction is critical: it means the science is not shaped by the preferences of a single billionaire.

**University partnerships without university constraints.** Arc partners with Stanford, UCSF, and UC Berkeley. Core Investigators can hold joint appointments with these universities, accessing students and clinical resources without being subject to university overhead rates, tenure clocks, or departmental politics. This hybrid model captures the best of both worlds: university talent pipelines with institute freedom.

**Technology development as first-class research.** Arc invests heavily in building new tools, not just using existing ones. The results have been remarkable:

- **Bridge recombinases (2024-2025)**: Arc researchers discovered and engineered RNA-guided recombinases that can insert, excise, or invert DNA segments up to a million base pairs in length. In human cells, the engineered ISCro4 successfully removed over 80% of the toxic repeat sequences that cause Friedreich's ataxia from artificial constructs. This is not incremental improvement over CRISPR -- it is a fundamentally different genome engineering paradigm.
- **Evo and Evo 2 (2024-2025)**: The first biological foundation model trained on DNA at scale, trained on 9.3 trillion tokens from 128,000+ genomes across all three domains of life. Evo 2 designed complete bacteriophage genomes that killed E. coli in the lab -- AI-designed organisms that function in reality.

**Phase 1 scale.** Arc is building gradually: 10-15 Core Investigators in Phase 1, each running groups of 10-20 researchers. This is wise. Culture cannot be hired at scale; it must be grown.

### What Arc Lacks for Drug Development

Arc is a basic science institute. This is by design, not by accident. But it means that the path from Arc's discoveries to patients contains every gap that exists between academic biology and clinical medicine:

**No medicinal chemistry.** Bridge recombinases are fascinating, but turning a recombinase system into a therapeutic requires formulation, delivery vehicles, manufacturing processes, and GMP-compliant production. Arc does none of this.

**No regulatory infrastructure.** Filing an IND (Investigational New Drug application) with the FDA or an IMPD (Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier) with the EMA requires pharmacology packages, toxicology studies, CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) documentation, and clinical trial protocols. Arc has no team for this.

**No DMPK capability.** Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics -- understanding how a molecule behaves in a living body -- is the bottleneck that kills most drug candidates. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, half-life, bioavailability: these are the unsexy parameters that determine whether a brilliant molecule becomes a medicine or a failed experiment.

**No clinical trial operations.** Even if Arc produced a clinical candidate tomorrow, it has no infrastructure to recruit patients, manage trial sites, collect data, or interact with regulators.

**No disease-first orientation.** Arc's model is investigator-driven: hire brilliant people and let them follow their curiosity. This produces breakthrough tools (bridge recombinases, Evo) but does not guarantee those tools will be aimed at specific diseases within a timeframe that matters to patients.

### The Gap This Chapter Addresses

A drug-oriented Arc would need everything Arc has -- intellectual freedom, long-term funding, talented investigators -- plus a translational capability layer that Arc deliberately omits. The question is whether these two things can coexist in one institution, or whether the discipline required for drug development inevitably suffocates the freedom required for discovery.

The thesis of this chapter: they can coexist, but only if the organizational architecture is designed from the beginning to hold both in tension.

## 15.2 Existing Models That Bridge Research and Drug Development

No institution perfectly combines academic freedom with drug development discipline. But several come close in different ways, and each offers lessons.

### MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), Cambridge, UK

**The gold standard for academic-to-drug translation.** The LMB has produced 12 Nobel Prizes shared among 16 individuals. More importantly for our purposes, it has generated over 700 million pounds in commercial income from technology transfer -- enough to cover both the LMB's complete running costs for the past five years and the cost of its new 212-million-pound building.

**How it works.** The MRC provides core funding set for five years at a time, currently approximately 170 million pounds per five-year cycle (roughly 34 million per year). The LMB has over 50 scientific groups and about 440 scientists. Individual groups have enormous autonomy in choosing research directions.

**The translation story that matters.** In the 1970s, Cesar Milstein and Georges Kohler at the LMB invented monoclonal antibodies -- and the UK's National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) failed to patent them, one of the most expensive mistakes in the history of technology transfer. The LMB learned from this. Greg Winter subsequently developed phage display for humanizing antibodies, which led to Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT), which developed the technology behind adalimumab (Humira) -- the best-selling drug in history, with cumulative global sales exceeding 214 billion pounds. CAT was acquired by AstraZeneca for approximately 700 million pounds in 2006. Other spinouts include Domantis, Protein Design Labs, Celltech, Biogen, and most recently Constructive Bio (2022, $15 million seed).

**Lesson for your institute.** The LMB demonstrates that a culture of intellectual freedom, properly coupled with technology transfer infrastructure, can produce both Nobel Prizes and blockbuster drugs. The key enabler is stable, long-term core funding that lets scientists take risks the grant system would never fund. The key failure mode is the NRDC mistake: brilliant science without IP protection generates no revenue for the institution.

### CeMM, Vienna -- The Drug-Oriented Academic Institute

**The closest existing model to what this chapter proposes.** CeMM (Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences) was built from scratch starting in 2005 by Giulio Superti-Furga, who remains its Scientific Director. Unlike most academic institutes, CeMM was designed from inception to sit at the intersection of basic research and drug discovery.

**What Superti-Furga built.** Located on the campus of the Medical University of Vienna, CeMM combines molecular biology with omics approaches, (bio)chemistry, and bioinformatics to understand the relationship between cellular metabolism and disease. The group actively promotes translational research through the design and discovery of small molecule drugs and through ex vivo assessment of drug action in cancer and inflammatory diseases.

**Commercial output.** CeMM has founded six spin-off companies, including:
- **Allcyte**: Uses the "Pharmacoscopy" high-content imaging platform (developed at CeMM) for preclinical drug development and clinical decision-making. Entered a strategic collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for preclinical oncology drug discovery.
- **Proxygen GmbH**: Develops therapies using molecular glue degraders -- small molecules that reprogram the cellular protein quality control system to destroy disease-causing proteins.
- **Haplogen** and **MyeloPro**: Additional spinouts from CeMM research.

**The Pfizer collaboration.** A three-year research collaboration between CeMM and Pfizer produced AI-driven drug discovery methods that measure how hundreds of small molecules bind to thousands of different human proteins. All models and data were made freely available to other researchers -- demonstrating that an academic institute can partner with Big Pharma while maintaining open science principles where appropriate.

**Superti-Furga's track record.** Co-founded five biotech companies, obtained four ERC grants, published more than 290 papers, and is a member of five scientific academies. His career demonstrates that a single individual with the right combination of scientific depth and entrepreneurial instinct can build a world-class institute from nothing.

**Lesson for your institute.** CeMM proves the concept: a drug-oriented academic institute is possible in Europe, funded primarily by a national academy of sciences, located on a medical campus, producing both high-impact science and commercial spinoffs. The scale is modest (compared to the Crick or Broad), but the model works.

### IMP Vienna -- The Industry-Funded Academic Institute

The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), also in Vienna, offers a different model: an academic research institute funded primarily by a pharmaceutical company. Founded in 1985 as a joint venture between Boehringer Ingelheim and Genentech, the IMP became wholly owned by Boehringer Ingelheim in 1993.

**The deal.** Boehringer Ingelheim provides the IMP's operating budget. In return, it gets proximity to world-class basic research, access to discoveries with translational potential, and one representative on an eight-member Scientific Advisory Board composed of internationally renowned scientists. IMP researchers publish freely and pursue their own research directions; Boehringer Ingelheim does not direct the science.

**Why this works.** Boehringer Ingelheim is a privately held company (the Boehringer family still controls it) with a long-term orientation that publicly traded pharma companies cannot match. This private ownership structure allows the kind of patient, relationship-based funding that a quarterly-earnings-driven company would never sustain.

**Lesson for your institute.** If you can find a privately held pharma company willing to underwrite your operating costs in exchange for first-look rights (not ownership) on discoveries, you have a sustainable funding model that does not depend on grant cycles or philanthropic whims. The price is a single point of failure: if your corporate sponsor restructures, your funding disappears.

### The Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) -- Open Science Drug Discovery

The SGC offers a radically different approach to precompetitive drug discovery. Founded in 2003, it is a UK-registered charity (no. 1097737) that operates across multiple universities (Toronto, Oxford, UNC Chapel Hill, and others) with funding from a consortium of pharmaceutical companies including Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Janssen, Merck KGaA, Pfizer, and Takeda.

**The open science model.** The SGC places all its research output into the public domain without restriction and does not file patents. Members contribute over 5.4 million euros per five-year period in exchange for board membership and influence over research priorities. The latest phase of Canadian-based SGC activities includes $11 million in federal funding through Genome Canada, $5 million from the Government of Ontario, and $17 million from pharmaceutical companies.

**What the SGC produces.** Chemical probes -- well-characterized small molecules that modulate specific protein targets. These are not drugs, but they are the starting points from which drugs can be developed. By making probes freely available, the SGC de-risks the earliest stage of drug discovery for everyone.

**Lesson for your institute.** You do not need to keep everything proprietary. Making early-stage tools (probes, assays, datasets) openly available can attract pharma partnership funding and build reputation, while reserving IP protection for later-stage drug candidates where commercial value is concentrated.

### DNDi -- Nonprofit Drug Development That Actually Works

The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), created in 2003, proves that a nonprofit can develop and register drugs. Since its founding, DNDi has developed 13 treatments for 6 deadly diseases (leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, malaria, filarial diseases, HIV).

**The cost structure.** DNDi's historical out-of-pocket expenses for drug development range from approximately 4 million euros (for drug repurposing or new combinations of existing drugs) to roughly 60 million euros (for new chemical entities requiring full discovery-to-registration development). These numbers are orders of magnitude below the pharma industry average of $2.23 billion per drug (Deloitte, 2024) because DNDi operates as a "virtual orchestra conductor," leveraging partners' assets, capacities, and expertise rather than building everything in-house.

**The delinkage principle.** DNDi applies "delinkage" -- separating the cost of R&D from the price of the final product. This means the incentive for investing in a particular disease is independent of the price at which the developed product will be sold. For neglected diseases with no commercial market, this is the only model that works.

**Lesson for your institute.** You do not need to build a complete pharma company. You need to build a scientific core with enough translational capability to advance programs to clinical proof-of-concept, then partner with CROs and pharma for the expensive later stages. DNDi's cost range -- 4 to 60 million euros per program -- is achievable for a well-funded nonprofit institute.

## 15.3 Legal and Funding Architecture for a European Research Institute

The legal structure you choose determines your tax status, governance flexibility, ability to receive different types of funding, and IP ownership rights. The right choice depends on which country you base in.

### Germany: The Stiftung

A Stiftung (foundation) under Sections 80-88 of the German Civil Code is a legal entity whose earnings on assets are used to pursue a specific purpose set by the founder.

**Requirements:**
- Minimum capital: EUR 50,000 (varies by state; this is a floor, not a ceiling -- for a research institute, you would need orders of magnitude more)
- Must be established in writing with a sufficiently definite purpose
- Recognized by the competent authority in the relevant Bundesland (federal state)
- Cannot be set up for less than 10 years (2013 Civil Code amendment)
- Both natural and legal persons can be founders

**Advantages:** Germany has nearly 26,000 foundations under civil law. The ecosystem is mature. The Max Planck Society itself is a registered association (eingetragener Verein, or e.V.) under German private law, demonstrating that world-class research institutions can operate under German nonprofit structures. The Max Planck model -- 50/50 federal-state funding, currently over 2.15 billion euros per year for 85 institutes -- shows what is possible at scale.

**Tax benefits:** Foundations pursuing charitable purposes (gemeinnutzige Stiftung) are exempt from corporate income tax and trade tax. Donors receive tax deductions.

**Best for:** Institutions planning to operate primarily in Germany, with German government co-funding as a core element. The Helmholtz Association (18 research centers, 45,000+ employees, ~5 billion euros annual budget) and the Leibniz Association are additional examples of German research organizations using nonprofit structures.

### Italy: The Fondazione

Under the Italian Civil Code (Articles 14-42) and Legislative Decree No. 117/2017 (Third Sector Code), Italian foundations are asset-based rather than membership-based entities.

**Requirements:**
- Must be established through a formal notarial deed (atto pubblico) before a notary public
- Must have a non-profit objective (scientific research qualifies)
- Requires an endowment of "sufficient financial resources" (no fixed minimum, but the endowment must be credibly adequate for the stated purpose)
- Governed by Presidential Decree No. 361/2000 for legal recognition and registration

**Real-world example: IIT (Italian Institute of Technology).** The IIT was established by the Italian government in 2003 as a foundation under private law, jointly overseen by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Economy. It receives approximately 90 million euros per year from the Italian government and operates a 25,000 sqm facility in Genova with over 500 staff from 30 countries. Its Drug Discovery and Development (D3) department demonstrates that an Italian fondazione can house drug discovery capabilities.

**Best for:** Institutions with strong Italian government support or Italian philanthropic backing. Italy's cost of living is significantly lower than Switzerland, the UK, or Germany, making operating budgets stretch further -- a postdoc in Genova or Rome costs substantially less than one in Basel or London.

### United Kingdom: The Charity

UK research institutes typically register as charities with the Charity Commission, governed by a Board of Trustees. The Francis Crick Institute is a registered charity; so are the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cancer Research UK.

**The Crick model.** Six founding partners (MRC, Cancer Research UK, Wellcome Trust, UCL, Imperial College London, King's College London) established the Crick as a charitable foundation in 2010. Annual budget exceeds 100 million pounds. Core funding for 2022-2029: approximately 1 billion pounds total (MRC: 406 million / 41%, CRUK: 458 million / 45%, Wellcome: 137 million / 14%).

**Advantages:** UK charity law is well-established for research. Tax exemptions are generous. The UK biotech ecosystem (particularly the Cambridge-London-Oxford "golden triangle") is the strongest in Europe. Post-Brexit, the UK has established its own regulatory frameworks while maintaining high scientific standards.

**Disadvantages:** Post-Brexit loss of direct access to EU funding programs (though the UK has associate membership in Horizon Europe). Sterling volatility creates budget uncertainty for internationally recruited staff.

**Best for:** Institutions targeting the Cambridge or London biotech ecosystems, with access to Wellcome Trust or MRC funding.

### The Multi-Country Option: The EMBL Model

EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) is an inter-governmental organization funded by more than 29 member states. Its budget is adopted by the EMBL Council, requiring a two-thirds majority of member states present and voting, provided those states contribute at least two-thirds of total contributions.

Every five years, the member states agree on an "Indicative Scheme" -- a five-year funding plan supporting the EMBL Programme. This model provides extraordinary stability but requires diplomatic infrastructure and multi-government buy-in that a startup institute cannot realistically achieve.

**Lesson:** Do not try to replicate the EMBL model from scratch. Instead, start in a single country with a strong legal framework, and build international partnerships organically.

### Funding Sources: A Layered Architecture

No single funding source will sustain a drug-oriented research institute. You need a layered architecture:

| Layer | Source | Contribution | Timeline |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Foundation capital** | Founding philanthropic gift | EUR 50-200M | Year 0 |
| **Government core funding** | National/regional research ministry | EUR 5-20M/year | Year 1+ |
| **Competitive grants** | ERC, Horizon Europe, national agencies | EUR 2-10M/year | Year 2+ |
| **Industry partnerships** | Pharma/biotech collaborations | EUR 3-15M/year | Year 3+ |
| **Licensing revenue** | IP from discoveries, spinoff equity | EUR 0-50M/year | Year 5+ |
| **Endowment returns** | Investment income on capital reserves | EUR 2-10M/year | Year 5+ |

**ERC grants as building blocks.** Individual ERC grants are substantial: Starting Grants up to 1.5 million euros, Consolidator Grants up to 2 million euros, Advanced Grants with similar budgets -- all for 5-year terms. If your institute houses 5 investigators who each hold ERC grants, that alone brings 10-15 million euros over five years. But ERC grants fund individuals, not institutes -- they follow investigators who move. They are a complement to institutional funding, not a substitute.

**Horizon Europe.** The 93.5-billion-euro Horizon Europe program (2021-2027) includes mechanisms for research infrastructure, partnerships (institutionalized, co-programmed, co-funded), and Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions. The 2025 Work Programme allocated 7.3 billion euros, with a move toward more open topic descriptions and increased use of lump sums.

**European philanthropists.** The philanthropic landscape in Europe is thinner than in the US, but several foundations operate at scale:
- **Novo Nordisk Foundation** (Denmark): Awarded DKK 5.5 billion (EUR 736 million) to the BioInnovation Institute for 2026-2035. Previously invested approximately 860 million dollars in the BII since its founding in 2020.
- **Wellcome Trust** (UK): Invests 1.2 billion pounds annually in research. The Seeding Drug Discovery program alone received 110 million pounds over five years.
- **Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation** (Germany): Funds the IMP Vienna and other basic research.
- **Simons Foundation**, **Open Philanthropy**, and **Good Ventures**: Increasingly active in European science funding.

## 15.4 The Drug Development Capability Layer

This is the section that separates a drug-oriented institute from a basic science institute. You need capabilities that most academic institutions do not have and that most academics have never even encountered.

### The Minimum Viable Drug Discovery Stack

To take a biological insight from validated target to IND-ready clinical candidate, you need the following capabilities. The question for each is: build in-house, or outsource to CROs?

| Capability | In-house or CRO? | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Target identification & validation** | In-house | This is your core competence. Never outsource your scientific edge. |
| **Assay development** | In-house | Biochemical and cellular assays that measure drug activity on your target. This is iterative and tightly coupled to biology. |
| **Hit finding (HTS or DEL)** | CRO or shared resource | High-throughput screening requires compound libraries (500K+ compounds) and robotic infrastructure. Use the European Lead Factory's shared library (535,000 compounds, free screening for European academics and SMEs) or partner with Evotec. |
| **Medicinal chemistry** | Hybrid (small in-house team + CRO) | You need at least 2-3 medicinal chemists in-house to maintain institutional knowledge and guide CRO work. Evotec, Domainex (UK), and IRBM (Pomezia, Italy) provide excellent contract medicinal chemistry. |
| **DMPK (Drug Metabolism & Pharmacokinetics)** | CRO | Highly specialized, equipment-intensive. Companies like Eurofins, Charles River, and Evotec handle this routinely. |
| **In vivo pharmacology** | CRO | Animal studies require specific licenses, facilities, and expertise. In Europe, regulations are stricter than in the US (Directive 2010/63/EU), making in-house vivaria expensive and administratively burdensome. |
| **Toxicology (GLP)** | CRO | Good Laboratory Practice toxicology is a regulated activity. Charles River, Covance (LabCorp), and Citoxlab provide these services across Europe. |
| **CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, Controls)** | CRO | GMP manufacturing of clinical supply is a specialized industrial capability. Do not attempt this in-house. |
| **Regulatory affairs** | In-house (1-2 people) | You need someone who understands EMA (and FDA) requirements, can prepare regulatory submissions, and can manage interactions with national competent authorities. |
| **Clinical operations** | CRO for trials, in-house for design | Clinical trial design should reflect your scientific insight. Execution (site management, data collection, monitoring) is best outsourced to clinical CROs like ICON (Dublin), Parexel, or smaller European specialists like Ergomed (UK) or Argint International (Central/SE Europe). |

### The European CRO Ecosystem

Europe has a mature CRO ecosystem that enables the "virtual pharma" model:

**Evotec (Hamburg, Germany)** is the most important partner for a European research institute pursuing drug discovery. Their BRIDGE (Biomedical Research, Innovation & Development Generation Efficiency) framework was designed specifically for academic-industry drug discovery partnerships, spanning more than 40 leading academic institutions. Evotec's key innovation is incentive alignment: collaborations are structured around shared IP, milestones, and royalties, which is rare in the contract research world. They provide integrated discovery from hit finding through preclinical development.

**IRBM (Pomezia, near Rome)** is a remarkable institution -- Italy's largest independent partner research organization for drug discovery. Originally established in 1990 as a joint venture between Merck & Co. and Sigma-Tau, it became Merck's Italian drug discovery site in 2000 before being divested in 2009 and reopening as an independent company in 2010. IRBM's scientists invented four marketed drugs: Zolinza (HDAC inhibitor for lymphomas), Isentress (first-in-class HIV integrase inhibitor), Grazoprevir (part of the HCV cure Zepatier), and Zejula (PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer). Over 25 candidates now in clinic, all from a team of 200+ multidisciplinary scientists in a single facility near Rome. This is proof that world-class drug discovery can happen in Italy.

**The European Lead Factory** provides free high-throughput screening of approximately 535,000 compounds to European academic laboratories and SMEs, with more than 250 screens completed on a wide variety of targets. The confidentiality model is clever: screening centers receive compound libraries without disclosure of compound structures, allowing proprietary pharma compounds to be screened while protecting trade secrets.

### Cost Benchmarks: Target to IND

Based on DNDi data, industry averages, and European CRO pricing:

| Phase | Estimated Cost (Europe) | Timeline |
|-------|------------------------|----------|
| Target validation | EUR 1-3M | 12-18 months |
| Hit identification (HTS/DEL) | EUR 0.5-2M | 6-12 months |
| Hit-to-lead | EUR 2-5M | 12-18 months |
| Lead optimization | EUR 3-8M | 12-24 months |
| Preclinical development (PK, tox, CMC) | EUR 3-10M | 12-18 months |
| IND/IMPD filing | EUR 0.5-1M | 3-6 months |
| **Total: Target to IND** | **EUR 10-30M** | **4-7 years** |

For comparison, the pharma industry average cost per approved drug is $2.23 billion (Deloitte, 2024), but this includes the cost of all failures. For a single program run efficiently through European CROs with academic cost structures, $10-30 million to reach IND is realistic. DNDi has registered drugs for as little as 4 million euros (repurposed combinations) to 60 million euros (new chemical entities).

### ATMP Considerations

If your institute works on gene therapies, cell therapies, or tissue-engineered products, these are classified as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) under EU Regulation 1394/2007. ATMPs must be evaluated under the centralized EMA procedure, with assessment by the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT). The EMA provides increased support for academic and nonprofit developers of ATMPs, including guidance throughout the regulatory process from manufacturing to clinical development. A guideline adopted in 2025 outlines quality, non-clinical, and clinical requirements for investigational ATMPs in clinical trials.

## 15.5 Real Founding Stories

Abstract principles are useful. Concrete founding stories are better. Here are the actual histories of institutes relevant to what you want to build, with specific numbers.

### The Broad Institute: Incremental Trust-Building

The Broad Institute did not begin with a $700 million check. It began with a conversation and a test.

**The timeline:**
- **2002-2003**: Planning among Eli Broad, Edythe Broad, MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard, and Harvard-affiliated hospitals. The key question: could a new organizational model -- independent from any single university but partnering with several -- produce better science?
- **2004**: Formal launch with an initial gift of $100 million over 10 years. This was explicitly framed as a test: the Broads wanted to see if the model worked before committing more.
- **2005**: After rapid early progress, a second $100 million gift.
- **2008**: $400 million endowment gift, enabling the Broad to transition to a permanent, independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Total Broad family commitment: $700 million.

**The governance innovation.** The Broad Institute is independently governed as its own nonprofit but jointly governed by MIT and Harvard. This triple governance structure (institute board + MIT + Harvard) is complex but prevents any single institution from dominating.

**Lesson:** Start small enough to be a test. If the test succeeds, the same donors (and new ones) will fund the scaling. Do not ask for $500 million on day one. Ask for $50 million for five years, with clear milestones that justify further investment.

### The Francis Crick Institute: Merging Existing Institutions

Paul Nurse's approach was the opposite of starting from scratch: he merged existing institutions into something new.

**The backstory.** After the turn of the millennium, Nurse (then President of Rockefeller University, having won the Nobel Prize for his work on cell-cycle control at the LMB and elsewhere) proposed merging the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) with Cancer Research UK's London Research Institute. The idea was controversial -- "there was a lot of opposition, partly because the institute was founded by merging multiple institutes together."

**The timeline:**
- **2006**: Independent review of UK health research funding commissioned by government.
- **2010**: Agreement signed by CRUK, MRC, UCL, and Wellcome Trust to establish the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation. Paul Nurse appointed first Director.
- **2015**: Legal entity created, staff transferred.
- **2016**: 1-billion-pound building opens in central London (behind St Pancras station).
- **2022**: 1 billion pounds of core funding secured for seven years (2022-2029).

**Nurse's operating principles.** Open academic recruitment, bottom-up research direction (topics set by researchers, not leadership), extensive network-building. The Crick now houses 1,500 staff including 1,250 scientists, making it the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe.

**Lesson:** If existing institutions in your country are underperforming or fragmented, a merger model may be more politically feasible than creation from nothing. You inherit staff, equipment, and track records. The price is political complexity and the need to manage cultural integration.

### CeMM: One Person, One Vision, From Scratch

Giulio Superti-Furga's founding of CeMM in 2005 is the closest parallel to what this chapter proposes. He started "literally from scratch" as Scientific Director, building an interdisciplinary research center within the organizational framework of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

**What made it possible:**
- **Institutional host.** The Austrian Academy of Sciences provided legitimacy, infrastructure, and initial funding without requiring CeMM to build administrative overhead from zero.
- **Medical campus location.** Situating CeMM on the campus of the Medical University of Vienna gave immediate access to clinical samples, clinical collaborators, and patient populations.
- **Personal credibility.** Superti-Furga had a track record at EMBL and in molecular biology that made the Austrian Academy willing to bet on him.
- **ERC funding.** Four ERC grants (Starting, Consolidator, Advanced) provided substantial additional funding tied to Superti-Furga personally.

**Timeline to impact:** CeMM was founded in 2005. By the early 2020s, it had produced six spinoff companies, a major Pfizer collaboration, and over 290 publications from Superti-Furga's group alone. This is a 15-20 year arc from founding to mature, productive institution.

### The Allen Institutes: Serial Founding by a Single Philanthropist

Paul Allen demonstrated that a single committed donor can create entire fields through sequential institution-building:

- **2003**: Allen Institute for Brain Science -- $100 million initial commitment, eventually $500 million total.
- **2014**: Allen Institute for Cell Science -- $100 million.
- **2018 (posthumous)**: Allen Institute for Immunology -- $125 million.
- **2014**: Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group -- $100 million for exploratory grants.

**The governance lesson.** After Allen's death in 2018, his sister Jody Allen became Board Chair. The institutes continue to operate because they were structured as independent nonprofits with endowments, not as extensions of a living donor's will. Any founding donor relationship must be designed to survive the donor's loss of interest, financial reversal, or death.

## 15.6 The European Advantage

The conventional wisdom is that the US is the only place to do serious drug development. This is wrong. Europe offers structural advantages that a well-designed institute can exploit.

### Lower Burn Rate

Everything costs less in Europe than in the US. This is not a marginal difference -- it fundamentally changes what is financially feasible.

**Salaries.** A postdoctoral researcher in the US earns approximately $72,800/year on average. In Germany, a postdoc starts at approximately EUR 54,000/year. In the UK, entry-level postdocs start at approximately GBP 34,000 (EUR 40,000). In France, approximately EUR 28,000. Adjusting for purchasing power (a one-bedroom flat costs EUR 2,200/month in London vs EUR 1,250 in Berlin vs EUR 980 in Brussels), European salaries deliver comparable or better quality of life at 30-60% lower nominal cost.

For a PI-level position, a US biotech hub salary of $250,000-350,000 compresses to EUR 80,000-120,000 in most of Europe (higher in Switzerland and London, lower in Vienna, Milan, or Barcelona). An institute with 50 scientists saves $5-10 million per year on salaries alone compared to a Bay Area equivalent.

**Lab space.** Life science lab space in Cambridge, MA costs $80-120 per square foot per year. In Cambridge, UK, it is GBP 40-65 per square foot. In Munich, Berlin, or Vienna, it is even less. A 25,000 sqm facility (like IIT Genova's) costs a fraction of what equivalent space would cost in Boston.

**CRO services.** Clinical trial per-participant costs in Western Europe average $15,000-25,000, lower than in the US. In Eastern European countries (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary), costs can be 40% lower still.

### Universal Healthcare = Easier Patient Recruitment

European universal healthcare systems provide something the US cannot: integrated health records and systematic access to patient populations. In the UK, the NHS provides a single-payer system covering 67 million people, with centralized databases (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics) that enable population-level studies impossible in the fragmented US system. Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland) have population-wide health registries dating back decades.

For clinical trials, this means faster patient identification, lower recruitment costs, and access to longitudinal health data that provides natural history comparisons and real-world evidence.

### European Biotech Clusters

**Basel, Switzerland.** Home to Novartis and Roche headquarters, Basel is Europe's pharma capital. In 2024, 26 of 36 companies that settled in the Basel region were in life sciences. Swiss biotechs raised more than $3 billion in 2024, a 22% increase over 2023.

**Cambridge, United Kingdom.** The densest biotech cluster in Europe. Home to AstraZeneca's global R&D center, the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Milner Therapeutics Institute, and the Babraham Research Campus (60+ companies, 2,000 employees, 300 academic researchers). The Milner Therapeutics Consortium connects three academic centers with 11 pharmaceutical companies (including AstraZeneca, BMS, Lilly, GSK, Pfizer), enabling free exchange of potential drug molecules between pharma and academia.

**Copenhagen/Medicon Valley, Denmark-Sweden.** Novo Nordisk, Lundbeck, LEO Pharma, and Ferring are headquartered here. The Novo Nordisk Foundation's massive investments (DKK 5.5 billion to BII alone) make this region the most generously philanthropically funded biotech cluster in Europe.

**Munich, Germany.** Strong in diagnostics, digital health, and industrial biotech. Proximity to the Max Planck Institutes and the Technical University of Munich.

**Leiden, Netherlands.** Proximity to EMA (European Medicines Agency, headquartered in Amsterdam). Strong in biologics manufacturing and vaccine R&D. Patent applications in life sciences are 30% higher than the European average.

### European VC Landscape

European biotech VC investment reached approximately $11 billion in 2024 and grew to approximately $13.4 billion in 2025, making healthcare/biotech the second-largest startup sector after AI. While this is smaller than US biotech VC (roughly $25-30 billion annually), it is growing fast and increasingly sophisticated.

### Regulatory Considerations

The EMA regulatory pathway differs from the FDA in ways that can be advantageous:

- **Median review times.** FDA median initial review: 303 days. EMA: 366 days. The FDA is faster, but the difference is modest.
- **Real-world evidence acceptance.** The EMA may accept more real-world data and adaptive trial designs than the FDA, which often emphasizes randomized controlled trials.
- **ATMP support.** The EMA provides specific support for academic and nonprofit ATMP developers, including regulatory guidance throughout development.
- **Cost.** EMA review fees are approximately EUR 138,700. FDA review fees are higher.
- **First-to-market.** 63.7% of drugs approved in both jurisdictions were approved first in the US, available a median of 90 days sooner. This is a disadvantage if speed to US market is critical, but for a European-based institute, EMA approval provides access to 450 million people across the EU.

## 15.7 The Dreamer's Concrete Playbook

Here is what the first decade looks like, year by year.

### Year 0: Conception (12-18 months before formal launch)

**Find your co-founders.** You need three types of people:
1. A scientific visionary with a track record in disease biology and drug discovery (this may be you)
2. An operational leader with pharma/biotech industry experience who understands the drug development process end-to-end
3. A fundraiser/diplomat who can navigate government funding agencies, philanthropists, and industry partnerships

Superti-Furga did (1) and (2) in one person. Collison brought (3) while Konermann and Hsu brought (1). Paul Nurse brought (1) and (3) while recruiting operational talent.

**Write the manifesto.** A clear, specific document articulating:
- What diseases you will target and why
- What scientific approach you will take
- What existing institutions fail to provide that yours will
- How you will balance discovery freedom with translational discipline
- What success looks like at 5, 10, and 20 years

**Choose your country.** Based on the legal frameworks above, the top three options for a drug-oriented research institute are:

| Country | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **UK (Cambridge)** | Strongest biotech ecosystem in Europe, Wellcome/MRC funding, English language, proximity to pharma | Post-Brexit funding complexity, high London costs, visa complications |
| **Germany (Munich or Berlin)** | Stiftung framework, Max Planck/Helmholtz ecosystem, strong government research funding, large pharma presence | Bureaucratic complexity, German language requirement for many government interactions |
| **Denmark (Copenhagen)** | Novo Nordisk Foundation, BioInnovation Institute, excellent quality of life, strong pharma ecosystem | Small country, limited domestic talent pool, high taxes |
| **Austria (Vienna)** | CeMM/IMP precedent, Medical University campus, reasonable costs, Austrian Academy support | Small country, limited VC ecosystem |
| **Italy (Rome/Milan/Genova)** | IIT and IRBM precedent, low costs, strong academic tradition, proximity to IRBM for CRO partnership | Government funding instability, bureaucratic challenges |
| **Switzerland (Basel)** | Pharma capital of Europe, highest salaries attract talent, political stability | Extremely expensive, not in EU (regulatory complexity) |

**Secure the founding gift.** You need EUR 30-50 million to credibly launch (enough for 3-5 years of operations while building additional funding streams). Target: 1-3 philanthropic donors who believe in the mission. In Europe, the most likely sources are:
- Family offices of European industrialists (the Strungmann twins funded BioNTech's founding with EUR 180 million)
- Corporate foundations (Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation, Novartis Foundation)
- US-based but internationally minded philanthropists (Open Philanthropy, Schmidt Futures)
- National innovation agencies (UK Research and Innovation, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Austrian Science Fund)

### Year 1: Foundation (Formal launch)

**Legal incorporation.** Establish the legal entity (Stiftung, fondazione, charity, or equivalent). Register with relevant authorities. Establish governance: board of trustees (5-7 members), scientific advisory board (8-10 members), and executive leadership (Scientific Director + COO).

**Recruit 3-5 founding investigators.** These hires define everything. Selection criteria:
- Scientific excellence (publications in top journals, demonstrated ability to make discoveries)
- Translational orientation (at least one prior engagement with drug discovery: patent, spinoff, pharma collaboration, or clinical trial involvement)
- Willingness to commit to 8-10 year terms
- Complementary expertise (one chemist, one computational biologist, one disease biologist, one tool-builder)

Compensation must be competitive with industry, not with academia. A founding PI should receive EUR 120,000-180,000 base salary plus EUR 1-3 million annual research budget. Total cost per founding PI: approximately EUR 2-4 million per year (salary + group + equipment + consumables).

**Secure physical space.** Ideal: co-location on a medical campus (like CeMM on the Medical University of Vienna campus or IIT in Genova). This provides proximity to patients, clinicians, and clinical samples. Initial space requirement: 2,000-5,000 sqm of lab + office space. Cost in a European secondary city: EUR 1-3 million per year.

**Establish CRO partnerships.** Sign framework agreements with:
- Evotec (hit finding, medicinal chemistry, BRIDGE partnership)
- IRBM (integrated drug discovery, especially if based in Italy)
- A European preclinical CRO for DMPK and toxicology (Charles River, Eurofins, or European specialist)

**Budget: Year 1**

| Item | Cost (EUR) |
|------|-----------|
| Founding PI salaries + groups (3-5 PIs) | 6-15M |
| Lab space and equipment | 3-8M |
| Administration and operations | 1-3M |
| CRO partnership initiation | 0.5-2M |
| Legal, governance, compliance | 0.3-0.5M |
| **Total Year 1** | **11-29M** |

### Year 2-3: First Programs

**Launch 3-5 drug discovery programs** aligned with founding investigator expertise. Each program should have:
- A clearly defined disease target
- A validated biological hypothesis
- An assay system for drug screening
- A defined decision point (go/no-go) within 18-24 months

**Apply for competitive funding.** Submit ERC grants (Starting, Consolidator, or Advanced depending on PI career stage). Apply for relevant Horizon Europe calls. Seek national research council funding.

**Begin compound screening.** Use the European Lead Factory's shared library for initial HTS campaigns. Engage Evotec or IRBM for focused medicinal chemistry on hits.

**Recruit second wave of investigators.** Add 3-5 more PIs, bringing total scientific staff to 80-150.

**Budget: Years 2-3 (annual)**

| Item | Cost (EUR) |
|------|-----------|
| PI salaries + groups (6-10 PIs) | 12-30M |
| Drug discovery programs (CRO costs) | 3-10M |
| Lab space and equipment | 2-5M |
| Administration and operations | 2-4M |
| **Total per year** | **19-49M** |

### Year 5: First Clinical Candidates

By year 5, with 3-5 programs running, at least one should have advanced to preclinical development. Expected status:
- 1-2 programs in lead optimization (medicinal chemistry, SAR studies)
- 1 program in preclinical development (GLP toxicology, PK studies, CMC)
- First IND/IMPD filing anticipated within 12-18 months

**First industry partnership.** By now, your published results and patent filings should attract pharmaceutical company interest. The Milner Therapeutics Consortium model -- where pharma companies contribute resources in exchange for early access to academic discoveries -- is a template. A partnership deal with a single pharma company could bring EUR 5-20 million upfront plus milestones.

**First spinoff company.** If one program shows exceptional commercial potential, consider spinning it out into a separate company (like CeMM's Proxygen or Allcyte). The institute retains equity and licensing rights; the spinoff raises VC to fund clinical development.

**Budget: Year 5 (annual)**

| Item | Cost (EUR) |
|------|-----------|
| PI salaries + groups (10-15 PIs) | 20-45M |
| Drug discovery and preclinical programs | 5-15M |
| Lab space (possibly new building) | 3-8M |
| Administration, regulatory, IP | 3-5M |
| Clinical trial preparation | 2-5M |
| **Total Year 5** | **33-78M** |

### Year 10: Maturity

**Target state:**
- 15-20 Core Investigators, 200-400 total staff
- 10-15 active drug discovery programs at various stages
- 2-3 programs in clinical trials (Phase I/II)
- 3-5 spinoff companies generating equity value
- Licensing revenue beginning to flow (EUR 2-10 million per year)
- Annual budget of EUR 50-100 million
- Funding mix: 30% philanthropy, 25% government grants, 20% industry partnerships, 15% competitive grants, 10% licensing/spinoff revenue

## 15.8 Who Has Done This and What You Can Learn From Them

### Patrick Collison: The Outsider Philanthropist

Collison's path to Arc is instructive. He did not start with a grand institute plan. He started with Fast Grants during COVID-19 -- a rapid-response program that awarded grants of $10,000-$500,000 with 30-minute applications and two-week funding decisions. Fast Grants exposed the dysfunction of the traditional grant system in real time: brilliant scientists with urgent COVID research proposals were waiting 12-18 months for NIH funding while a simple web form and PayPal transfers moved money in days.

The lesson Collison extracted: the bottleneck in science is not talent or ideas -- it is the institutional infrastructure that funds, organizes, and supports research. Arc was the institutional response.

**What you can learn:** Build credibility through a small, fast, demonstrably effective intervention before attempting the big institution. Fast Grants cost relatively little but generated enormous goodwill, attention, and data about what scientists actually need.

### Giulio Superti-Furga: The Scientist-Builder

Superti-Furga built CeMM as a scientist, not as a philanthropist or administrator. His scientific credibility -- work on tyrosine kinases in cancer, drug mechanism elucidation, proteome and lipidome organization -- was the foundation on which everything else was built. He obtained four ERC grants, co-founded five biotech companies, and published 290+ papers while simultaneously building and directing the institute.

**What you can learn:** If you are the scientist-founder (not the philanthropist-founder), your scientific output is your institute's reputation. You cannot stop doing science to run the institute -- you must do both. This requires an exceptional operational partner (COO) who handles administration while you maintain scientific leadership.

### Paul Nurse: The Nobel Laureate Merger Artist

Nurse used his Nobel Prize and Rockefeller University presidency as leverage to propose something politically audacious: merging the MRC's NIMR and Cancer Research UK's LRI into a new entity that would be bigger and better funded than either. He faced significant opposition from other universities who resented the concentration of resources.

**What you can learn:** If existing institutions in your country are underperforming, the merger path may be faster than starting from scratch. But it requires extraordinary political capital -- a Nobel Prize helps -- and the ability to manage the human pain of institutional change.

### The Young Founder Question

Can someone under 40 build a research institute? The historical record suggests it is possible but rare at this scale. Konermann and Hsu were in their mid-30s when they co-founded Arc, but they had Collison's resources behind them. In biotech, as many lasting companies were started by CEOs under 40 as by experienced ones -- Genentech and Gilead were both started by founders younger than 30.

The more relevant question: at what career stage do you have enough scientific credibility and personal network to attract founding donors and founding investigators? Typically, this requires at least one major discovery, an established publication record, and a network of senior scientists willing to vouch for you. For most people, this comes in the late 30s to mid-40s -- but there is no law against being early.

---

## 15.9 The Financial Model

### Option 1: The Endowment Model (HHMI-style)

HHMI has a $22.6 billion endowment generating approximately $825 million per year in research spending. The Institute supports approximately 250 investigators at about $1 million per investigator per year.

**The math for your institute.** At a 4.8% spending rate (the average for US endowments in FY24):

| Annual operating budget | Required endowment |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| EUR 20M/year | EUR 420M |
| EUR 50M/year | EUR 1.04B |
| EUR 100M/year | EUR 2.08B |

A pure endowment model requires enormous upfront capital. Few European philanthropists can provide this. The Broad Institute took $700 million from a single family over 6 years; the Allen Institutes consumed over $800 million from Paul Allen. In Europe, only the Novo Nordisk Foundation (which has allocated hundreds of millions to BII) operates at comparable scale.

**Verdict:** Aspire to build an endowment over time, but do not rely on it as the primary funding model in the first decade.

### Option 2: The Venture Philanthropy Model (CFF-style)

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's venture philanthropy model is the single most successful example of nonprofit drug development generating financial returns. The Foundation invested approximately $150 million in Vertex Pharmaceuticals to develop cystic fibrosis drugs. When the drugs (Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko, and eventually Trikafta) succeeded, the Foundation sold its royalty rights to Royalty Pharma for $3.3 billion in 2014 -- a 22x return on investment.

**How to apply this model:** Your institute invests in drug development programs (using its own research plus CRO partnerships). When programs reach clinical proof-of-concept, you license them to pharma or spin them out into companies, retaining royalties or equity. If even one program produces a marketed drug, the financial returns can fund the entire institute for decades.

**The risk:** Most drug programs fail. If you run 10 programs over 10 years at EUR 5-10 million each (EUR 50-100 million total investment), you might get 1-2 to clinical stage and maybe 0-1 to market. The CFF model worked because CF biology was well-understood and Vertex was exceptionally competent. You cannot count on this.

**Verdict:** Structure every drug program with IP protection that enables licensing or spinoff. Even failed programs may generate valuable tool compounds, datasets, or assay platforms that have licensing value. But do not build a financial plan that depends on pharmaceutical revenue in the first decade.

### Option 3: The Hybrid Model (Recommended)

The sustainable model is a blend:

| Revenue source | Year 1-5 | Year 5-10 | Year 10+ |
|---------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Founding philanthropy | 60-70% | 30-40% | 10-20% |
| Government core funding | 15-20% | 20-25% | 20-25% |
| Competitive grants (ERC, Horizon) | 10-15% | 15-20% | 15-20% |
| Industry partnerships | 0-5% | 10-15% | 15-20% |
| Licensing/spinoff revenue | 0% | 5-10% | 15-25% |
| Endowment returns | 0% | 0-5% | 10-15% |

The key transition: from philanthropic dependency in years 1-5, to a diversified model in years 5-10, to potential self-sustainability by year 15-20. The MRC LMB achieved this -- its 700 million pounds in commercial income now exceeds its government funding. But this took 60+ years. The CFF achieved it in 15 years through a single spectacular success. Plan for the 20-year timeline; hope for the 15-year version.

### IP Strategy

**Open where possible, proprietary where necessary.** Follow the SGC model for early-stage tools: make chemical probes, assay systems, and screening data freely available. This builds reputation, attracts talent, generates publications, and accelerates the field. But when a compound series shows genuine drug potential (selectivity, potency, favorable PK), file patents and protect the IP.

The critical decision point: at what stage does a project transition from open science to proprietary development? A good rule of thumb: open science through target validation and probe discovery; proprietary from hit-to-lead onward. This maximizes the scientific impact of early work while preserving the commercial value of later-stage assets.

## 15.10 The Organizational Architecture

### The Dual-Track Structure

The central organizational challenge is maintaining both discovery freedom and translational discipline within one institution. The solution is a dual-track structure:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐

```

**Discovery Arm.** Core Investigators have 8-10 year renewable appointments with full freedom to pursue their research directions. No drug development milestones required. Publication encouraged. This arm operates like Arc or the LMB: hire brilliant people, give them resources, and get out of the way.

**Translation Arm.** A separate team of drug discovery professionals (medicinal chemists, pharmacologists, regulatory experts, project managers) who take validated discoveries from the Discovery Arm and advance them toward the clinic. This arm operates like a lean biotech company: milestones, go/no-go decisions, CRO management, IP filings.

**Project Transfer Committee.** A small group (3-5 people: Scientific Director, Head of Translation, 1-2 external experts, 1 Core Investigator representative) that evaluates discoveries for translational potential and decides which ones enter the Translation Arm. This committee is the organizational fulcrum -- it must balance scientific ambition with translational realism.

### Investigator Evaluation

Core Investigators should be evaluated on a 5-year cycle (within their 8-10 year terms) based on:
- Scientific impact (publications, citations, invited talks -- standard academic metrics)
- Tool and method development (new assays, new technologies, new datasets)
- Translation output (discoveries that entered the Translation Arm, regardless of outcome)
- Training (postdocs and students who went on to successful careers)

Critically: investigators should NOT be evaluated on drug development outcomes. A Core Investigator who produces three discoveries that all fail in translation but generates fundamental biological insights and trains excellent scientists has succeeded. The Translation Arm bears responsibility for translational success or failure.

## 15.11 The Manifesto: What This Institute Would Stand For

Every institution needs a founding document that articulates not just what it does, but why it exists and what principles govern its decisions. Here are the principles that should define a drug-oriented European research institute.

### Principle 1: Disease-First, Mechanism-Grounded

Every program starts with a disease and works backward to biology. This is the opposite of most academic research, which starts with a biological mechanism and hopes it might someday be relevant to disease. But the disease orientation is grounded in deep mechanistic understanding -- not phenotypic screening without hypothesis (though that has its place), but rigorous elucidation of molecular mechanisms followed by rational intervention design.

Target diseases that pharma ignores because the market is not large enough: rare diseases, neglected tropical diseases, diseases of aging in low-income populations, neuropsychiatric conditions where endpoints are poorly defined. These are the white spaces from Chapter 12 where a nonprofit institute has a structural advantage over profit-driven pharma.

### Principle 2: Open Science Where Possible, Proprietary Where Necessary

All basic biology -- target identification, pathway elucidation, disease mechanism characterization -- should be published openly. Chemical probes and research tools should be shared freely (following the SGC model). But drug candidates with genuine clinical potential must be protected by patents to enable licensing, partnership, or spinoff that generates revenue for the institute. The boundary between open and proprietary should be explicit, principled, and subject to institutional review.

### Principle 3: European Base, Global Ambition

Headquartered in Europe to take advantage of lower costs, stronger public healthcare systems, and regulatory access to 450 million EU citizens. But with global ambitions: recruiting investigators from anywhere in the world, publishing in international journals, partnering with US and Asian pharma companies, and eventually seeking both EMA and FDA approval for drug candidates.

### Principle 4: Integrated Computational + Experimental + Clinical Teams

The full-stack biology principle from this book's earlier chapters, applied at institutional scale. Every disease program should have computational biologists, experimental biologists, and clinicians working together from day one -- not sequentially (biologists discover, then clinicians translate) but in parallel, with constant bidirectional feedback.

### Principle 5: 10-Year Investigator Commitments

Renewable 10-year appointments (not 3-year grant cycles, not 5-year tenure clocks) that give investigators the time horizon required for truly ambitious programs. Drug development cannot be done in 3-year increments. The LMB, HHMI, and Arc all demonstrate that long-term funding produces disproportionately high-impact science.

### Principle 6: Disciplined Translation Pipeline

Every discovery that enters the Translation Arm must pass through predefined stage gates with quantitative go/no-go criteria. This is not academic culture -- it is pharma discipline applied to nonprofit research. Programs that fail criteria are killed quickly and resources are redirected. The goal is not to sustain programs indefinitely but to advance the best programs as rapidly as possible while failing the rest cheaply.

### Principle 7: Training as a Core Mission

The institute should train the next generation of drug-discovery-capable scientists -- people who understand both the biology and the translation process. Most academic training programs produce scientists who have never seen a lead optimization campaign, an IND filing, or a clinical trial. This institute's trainees should graduate with exposure to every stage of the drug development process.

---

## 15.12 The Uncomfortable Questions

### Can one institution really do both discovery and drug development?

The honest answer: very few have succeeded. Pharma companies do drug development but are increasingly bad at discovery. Academic labs do discovery but have no translational capability. The institutions that bridge both (LMB, CeMM) succeed by maintaining clear organizational boundaries between the two activities and by having exceptional leaders who understand both cultures.

The risk: the translation arm's need for milestones and discipline infects the discovery arm, turning it into a contract research organization. Or the discovery arm's academic culture infects the translation arm, turning it into a place where programs are never killed and decisions are never made. The dual-track structure described in Section 15.10 is designed to prevent both failure modes, but it requires constant vigilance from leadership.

### How do you recruit top scientists to a new, unproven institute?

The first 3-5 hires are everything. These people are betting their careers on an institution that has no track record, no building, and no publications. Why would they come?

- **Scientific vision.** If your manifesto is compelling and your co-founders are credible, ambitious scientists will see an opportunity to do work that is impossible at existing institutions.
- **Freedom.** 8-10 year appointments with no grant writing. For a talented mid-career scientist drowning in the grant treadmill, this is transformative.
- **Resources.** EUR 1-3 million annual research budgets per PI, fully funded from day one.
- **Speed.** No university overhead, no departmental politics, no committee approvals for equipment purchases.
- **Equity-like incentives.** Consider offering investigators a share of licensing revenue from discoveries they initiate. This is unusual in academia but standard in industry, and it aligns incentives.

### What if the founding donor's vision diverges from the scientific direction?

This is why governance matters. The board of trustees must have a majority of independent members who are not donors. The scientific advisory board must have full authority over investigator hiring and research direction. The founding donor should have a seat on the board but not a veto. This was Collison's approach with Arc -- he is a co-founder and donor, but not an operator.

Put this in the founding documents. Write it into the articles of incorporation. Make it legally binding. The worst outcome for a research institute is a donor who believes their money gives them the right to direct the science.

### Is this realistic, or is it a fantasy?

Consider what already exists:
- CeMM was built from scratch in 2005 by one scientist with no prior institute-building experience.
- The Broad Institute launched with $100 million and grew to a $700 million endowment within 6 years.
- IIT in Italy was created by government decree in 2003 and now has 500+ staff and EUR 90 million annual budget.
- IRBM was divested from Merck in 2009 and rebuilt into an independent drug discovery powerhouse with 200+ scientists.
- Arc launched in 2021 and has already produced breakthrough discoveries (bridge recombinases, Evo).

Each of these stories required a specific combination of vision, funding, talent, and timing. None of them was inevitable. All of them required someone who looked at the existing landscape and decided: this is not good enough, and I can build something better.

That someone could be you.

*The preceding fourteen chapters mapped the landscape of disease, technology, and career paths. This chapter proposes something different: that the reader who has absorbed all of that knowledge might be the person best positioned to build the institution the world needs. The tools exist. The funding mechanisms exist. The legal frameworks exist. The European ecosystem is ready. What is missing is someone with the vision, the scientific credibility, and the audacity to put it all together.*

*The next chapter has not been written yet. That is because you have to write it.*
